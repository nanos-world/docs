.. tip:: Spawn player at specific location see: :ref:`Tutorial-Spawn-Player`



About
-----

When a player enters the server, the player must be assigned to a character. 
The player can be spawned at random predefined locations.
Each time the player dies or spawns again, a random location should be determined.
As soon as the player leaves the server, the character must be removed as well.
