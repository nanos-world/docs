How to use the material picker tool in nanos world Forge

The **Material Picker** tool lets you quickly identify materials by clicking on them directly in the viewport. It's especially useful when working with meshes that use multiple materials and you need to find a specific one.

## How to Use

To use it, simply click on the picker icon in the interface, then click on any surface in your level that has a material applied. The tool will automatically detect the selected material.

Once a material is picked, you can either browse to it in the content browser or edit it directly in the material editor.
