nanos world **Cables** are composed primarily of two Unreal Engine components: a [Cable](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/CableComponent/UCableComponent/index.html) and a [PhysicsConstraint](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/Physics/Constraints/ConstraintsBlueprints/index.html). The first is used for visual purposes only and the second one gives the effective physical effects that are applied to each end of the Cable.

:::info

Cable **visuals** can be tweaked with `:SetForces()`, `:SetCableSettings()` and `:SetRenderingSettings()` methods. Those methods don’t have effect on the physics being applied and only have effects on the visual representation.

Cable **physics** can be tweaked with `:SetAngularLimits()` and `:SetLinearLimits()`.

:::

After attaching the two sides of your cable, the physics can be tweaked to affect how the constraint will affect the objects.

:::tip

Cables are automatically **destroyed** when one of the sides are detached

## 🎒 Examples

```lua title="Server/Index.lua"
local my_cable = Cable(Vector())
local cube_01 = Prop(Vector(100, 100, 100), Rotator(), "nanos-world::SM_Cube")
local cube_02 = Prop(Vector(200, 0, 100), Rotator(), "nanos-world::SM_Cube")

my_cable:AttachStartTo(cube_01)
my_cable:AttachEndTo(cube_02)
```
