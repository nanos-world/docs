Special cases for some linux os & ARM platform server installation.


:::caution

The installation on versions on and below Debian 11, Ubuntu 20 and ARM systems is not officially supported and currently maintained by the community! The following steps are WIP and may change at any time!

:::


## Linux Debian 11 Installation

:::warning

Please be careful with scripts and commands, do it at your own risk!

:::

If you are running debian 10 or older, please upgrade to debian 11 or change your operating system to at least Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS

:::tip

This will fix this type of error: `version GLIBCXX 3.4.30 not found` or/and `version GLIBC 2.34 not found`

:::

Since nanos world use `gcc 11`, we will need to upgrade one of our package to the testing repository.

### With a Script

You can run this script to install the required libraries, but please look at the script code to see what the script will do. (make sure you run it as root!)

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Falaxir/nanos-world_yolks-game-panels/master/docker-oses/debian/fixglibcxx.sh | bash
```

### Manually

First, update your `sources.list` file (located in: `/etc/apt/sources.list`), you will need to add the testing repo source, you can add theses lines below to your sources:

```text
deb http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ testing main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/ testing main contrib non-free
```

After that, we will need to create a `preferences` file that will tell our system to not prefer installing testing package over stable unless specified. In `/etc/apt/preferences` (create if it doesnâ€™t exists), add theses lines:

```text
Package: *
Pin: release a=stable
Pin-Priority: 900

Package: *
Pin: release a=testing
Pin-Priority: 400
```

Now, update your server to make sure that your system can find testing repositories with this command:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

We will install `libstdc++6` testing package to the server, it will allow the server to start correctly. You can type the command below to install it:

```bash
sudo apt-get --target-release testing install libstdc++6
```

:::tip

Finished! You can now proceed to the next steps to configure your nanos world server.

:::

## Linux Ubuntu 20

Ubuntu 20 doesn't have the latest libraries, and so, nanos world is not supported for this and older ubuntu operating systems.

It will be easier to upgrade your server to ubuntu 22 than to make the nanos world server work on ubuntu 20

There is a lot of guides like [this one](https://jumpcloud.com/blog/how-to-upgrade-ubuntu-20-04-to-ubuntu-22-04) for the steps of how to upgrade your server.

## Linux ARM (raspberry & more)

:::warning

EXPERIMENTAL: Use at your own risk!

:::

Nanos world server is not officially supported on Arm, but if you really really really want your server to be running on arm platform such as a raspberry, rockpro64, ... then you can!

:::caution

This guide on ARM has been tested and partially working on older nanos world server (before the migration from gcc 9 to gcc 11 on november 2022) and is probably outdated!

:::

We will need 2 emulators:

* box64 for Nanos World server : https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64
* box86 for steam : https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86

You must build & install these emulators on your board.
box86 is optional if you don't want to use steamcmd to download & update the server

Follow CAREFULLY the instructions on the emulators repository, commands are different in function of the board.

Example :
* RK3399 is for Pine64, RockPro64, Orange Pi, ...

:::caution

These steps have been tested on Armbian Bullseye 64bits (aarch64) on a rockpro64. Some extra steps might be required for other boards & distros

:::


### Box86

To install it, simply follow the instructions here: https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86/blob/master/docs/COMPILE.md

If for some reason, your system cannot find Box86 and you are on a 64bits os, run theses commands:
```
sudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libc6:armhf libncurses5:armhf libstdc++6:armhf
```

### Box64

Clone the repository, then we will need to replace the file `libstdc++.so.6` inside the folder `x64lib`.
You will need a newer version of this file with at least `GLIBCXX v3.4.26`.
You can grab it inside an updated Linux distro such as Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 11.
To check if the file has at least `GLIBCXX v3.4.26`, use this command :
```
strings libstdc++.so.6 | grep LIBCXX
```

If it shows `GLIBCXX v3.4.26`, you can put this file inside `x64lib` folder.

You can now follow the rest of the instructions here (starting from `mkdir` steps since you already cloned the repo): https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/blob/main/docs/COMPILE.md


### Steam & Server

You have now installed the emulators, they should be able to auto-detect if a program needs a x86_64/x86 emulation or not.

Get steamcmd manually on a folder with this command :

```
curl -sqL "https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd_linux.tar.gz" | tar zxvf -
```

You can now follow the basic instructions of nanos world Linux installation starting from steamcmd (run steamcmd with this command: `./steamcmd.sh`).


:::tip

Finished! You can now proceed to the next steps to configure your nanos world server.
