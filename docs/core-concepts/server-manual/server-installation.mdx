Creating servers in nanos world is very simple and straightforward, just a few steps and you have your server up and ready!

## Minimum System Requirements

* **OS**: [Windows](#windows) or [Linux*](#linux)
* **Processor**: `2x 1.0 GHz` (faster cores is better than many cores)
* **Memory**: `50 MB` (grows if having too many Players or spawned Entities)
* **Storage**: `30 MB` (+ Assets & Packages size)
* **Network**: Recommended at least `1 MB/s` (grows if having too many Players or spawned Entities)
* **Network Forwarded Ports**: `7777 TCP/UDP` and `7778 UDP` (you can change that in the Config)


## Windows

:::info Requirements

The Windows server needs the latest [**Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable**](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) to work.

:::

On Windows, you have **three** options for downloading nanos world server:

1. Use the executable (*.exe*) already located at `nanos-world/Server/NanosWorldServer.exe` (if you downloaded the base game).
2. Or download **nanos world™ Dedicated Server** tool from Steam Client.
3. Use [SteamCMD](#downloading-using-steamcmd).


## Linux

:::info Recommended and Tested Distros

Our Linux servers are current compiled in a **Ubuntu 22.04** machine (with [glibc](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Glibc%20Timeline) version **2.35**).

The following Distros are currently granted to be supported out of the box:

- `Ubuntu 22.04`
- `Debian 12.0`

You can see a community created page with instructions on how to install the server on other distros and versions [here](server-linux-arm).

:::


On Linux, the only way to download the server is through SteamCMD. If you are on Ubuntu/Debian, you can easily install it like that:

```shell
sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lib32gcc1 steamcmd
```

**Note**: on Linux, you must start the server using the Shell Script `./NanosWorldServer.sh`, which will configure proper paths and needed dynamic libraries which need to be loaded!


## Downloading using SteamCMD

To download the server through SteamCMD (a command line version of Steam) please [download it](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Downloading_SteamCMD) before proceeding.


#### 1. After downloaded, run `steamcmd` executable, once loaded you will get into it's console:

```bash
Steam>
```

#### 2. You can optionally define an installation folder to install nanos world server:

```bash
Steam> force_install_dir C:/nanos-world-server/
```

#### 3. The next step is to login on SteamCMD, you can login anonymously with:

```bash
Steam> login anonymous
```

#### 4. You can then install or update nanos world server using it's app id: `1936830`:

```bash
Steam> app_update 1936830
```

#### And you are done! You can quit the console:

```bash
Steam> quit
```


## Installing bleeding-edge version

To install the `bleeding-edge` version of the server, you will need to specify it's branch when installing:

```bash
Steam> app_update 1936830 -beta bleeding-edge
```


## Automated Installation

An easier way to install or update nanos world server is using an one-liner command to run SteamCMD:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="windows"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="windows">

```shell
steamcmd.exe +force_install_dir C:/nanos-world-server +login anonymous +app_update 1936830 validate +quit
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">

```shell
steamcmd +force_install_dir ~/nanos-world-server +login anonymous +app_update 1936830 validate +quit
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

or on bleeding-edge:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="windows"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="windows">

```shell
steamcmd.exe +force_install_dir C:/nanos-world-server +login anonymous +app_update 1936830 -beta bleeding-edge validate +quit
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">

```shell
steamcmd +force_install_dir ~/nanos-world-server +login anonymous +app_update "1936830 -beta bleeding-edge" validate +quit
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finished! You can now proceed to the next steps to configure your nanos world server.
