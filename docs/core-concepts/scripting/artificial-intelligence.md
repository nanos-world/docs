How AI works in nanos world

:::caution

🚧 This page is under construction.

:::

Every <Classes.Character /> or <Classes.CharacterSimple /> spawned without a <Classes.Player /> possessing it will automatically be possessed by an **AI** Controller. Which means you can use Character methods such as <MethodReference type="Class" class_name="Pawn" method="MoveTo" is_base /> and <MethodReference type="Class" class_name="Character" method="LookAt" />.

In nanos world, AI as well as Physics are things distributed through Clients to be calculated and shared with the other Players \(please refer to [Network Authority](/core-concepts/scripting/authority-concepts.mdx#network-authority)\), which means the **AI** will only work if there is a Player connected to the server.

:::info

If you input a NPC to <MethodReference type="Class" class_name="Entity" method="IsValid" is_base /> somewhere and there is no Player connected, he will only start walking once a Player joins the server.

:::

## Navigation Mesh

In order to NPCs to figure out the path to walk, the map will need to have a [NavMesh](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/Resources/ContentExamples/NavMesh/) configured.
