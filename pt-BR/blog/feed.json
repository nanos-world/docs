This has resolved several errors and issues that were occurring during runtime package reloads.</p>\n<p>We also fixed a common client-side issue where a \"default map\" package couldn't be found when executing <code>package reload all</code>.</p>\n<p>Related <a href=\"https://github.com/nanos-world/issues/issues/968\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Issue#968</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"ragdoll-sync\">Ragdoll Sync<a href=\"https://docs.nanos.world/pt-BR/blog/may-2025#ragdoll-sync\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Ragdoll Sync\" title=\"Direct link to Ragdoll Sync\">​</a></h2>\n<video controls=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" preload=\"none\" autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\"><source src=\"https://github.com/nanos-world/docs/raw/master/external/videos/blog/2025-may/ragdoll-sync.webm\"></video>\n<p class=\"media-legend\">Ragdoll location and rotation being networked</p>\n<p>Since some recent Unreal updates, ragdoll syncing became too rigid and resulted in strange movement.

Most of the relevant ones got a proper fix, and a few were moved over to the <a href=\"http://feedback.nanos.world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Feedback Board</a>, since they were more about missing features than actual bugs. There are still more issues already in my plans to be worked soon, my goal is to reach zero open issues!</p>\n<p>And with this cleanup, we've officially passed the 1,000 closed issues milestone (with most of those properly fixed)! 🎉 And we are not even counting the many bugs reported casually on Discord.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.nanos.world/pt-BR/assets/images/github-issues-2f4b92b9e20f1ee2ad9dc5f42a03e932.webp\" width=\"1255\" height=\"64\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p class=\"media-legend\">GitHub Issues count reached 1000 closed issues</p>\n<p>There's still a lot I want to improve.

game:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Game</strong>: Time the main execution thread (Unreal Ticks, Timers, Networking, Lua Code, UI, etc) spent to run the frame.</li>\n<li><strong>Render</strong>: Time the render thread spent preparing commands for RHI thread</li>\n<li><strong>RHI</strong>: (Render Hardware Interface) Time the DX11 or DX12 thread spent sending operations to

thread will always wait for the other threads to finish (waiting to catch up to either one or two frames behind from the render thread), so you can identify which thread your game-mode is

The FPS wasn't great and we could clearly see that the GPU wasn't being used at it's most (we had a main thread (CPU) bottleneck).</p>\n<p>By analyzing the frame, I could see that the culprit was it's NavMesh being recalculated every frame (as we use Dynamic Nav Mesh generation), and it was spending HUGE time on game thread.</p>\n<p>Then I ended up figuring out that the reason was some objects in the map causing that:</p>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"that-static-boat\">That Static Boat<a href=\"https://docs.nanos.world/pt-BR/blog/april-2025#that-static-boat\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to That Static Boat\" title=\"Direct link to That Static Boat\">​</a></h4>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.nanos.world/pt-BR/assets/images/boat-lag-bbe243fb9e75c36dd7e0330a78fdf0cf.webp\" width=\"1919\" height=\"484\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p class=\"media-legend\">Static Boat in the Cabin of Testing Map</p>\n<p>This Boat is just an Actor in the map with buoyancy enabled, but it had the \"Can Even Affect Navigation\" setting enabled, and it was causing all the NavMesh around it being recalculated every frame.</p>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"props\">Props<a href=\"https://docs.nanos.world/pt-BR/blog/april-2025#props\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Props\" title=\"Direct link to Props\">​</a></h4>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.nanos.world/pt-BR/assets/images/props-navmesh-4d68aaf9ee3b1981638d2ac19a8aaccf.webp\" width=\"1919\" height=\"553\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p class=\"media-legend\">Props not affecting Nav Mesh anymore</p>\n<p>Another escalating entity that was also affecting the NavMesh was the Prop. It also had the Affect Navigation toggle enabled, and the performance was being drastically drained when we had a bunch of Props in the map.</p>\n<p>Of course it could cause some drawbacks, like NPCs walking through Props and kicking them away, but the performance gain is immensurable. And also I'm studying the possibility to add a new method to programmatically enable/disable Props from affecting the Nav Mesh, so if you really need it, you can enable per Prop.</p>\n<p>This fix is absolutely a huge improvement, it's very noticeable how smoother is playing on Testing Map now.</p>\n<div class=\"theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip admonition_xJq3 alert alert--success\"><div class=\"admonitionHeading_Gvgb\"><span class=\"admonitionIcon_Rf37\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 12 16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z\"></path></svg></span>tip</div><div class=\"admonitionContent_BuS1\"><p>Those improvements will not only improve the testing-map, but also all other maps in the game, including yours!</p></div></div>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"testing-map-shadows\">Testing Map Shadows<a href=\"https://docs.nanos.world/pt-BR/blog/april-2025#testing-map-shadows\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Testing Map Shadows\" title=\"Direct link to Testing Map Shadows\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Another issue we were having was with the lighting/shadows of the testing map, we had Dynamic Shadows enabled for all grass meshes, which is usually a bad decision as it consumes a lot of GPU performance.</p>\n<p>So I changed all grass shadows to use the Contact Shadows method, which is way efficient, and the visual results were quite very similar:</p>\n<img-comparison-slider class=\"img-comparison-slider-zoomable\" style=\"max-width:100%\"><figure slot=\"first\" class=\"before\"><img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://docs.nanos.world/img/blog/2025-april/shadows-bef.webp\" style=\"transform-origin:bottom\"><figcaption style=\"bottom:10px\">Before (Dynamic Shadows)</figcaption></figure><figure slot=\"second\" class=\"after\"><img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://docs.nanos.world/img/blog/2025-april/shadows-aft.webp\" style=\"transform-origin:bottom\"><figcaption style=\"bottom:10px\">After (Contact Shadows)</figcaption></figure></img-comparison-slider><p class=\"media-legend\">Comparison Before (with Dynamic Shadows ON) and After (with Contact Shadows ON) focusing on Grass</p>\n<p>Also, our Torches were causing huge FPS loss when getting close to it, you can see almost 4ms was spent when looking directly to it.</p>\n<p>And with the change of contact shadows, we could notice a huge performance gain (the Shadow Depths pass went from ±4.35ms to ±2.26ms), which frees a lot of GPU usage:</p>\n<img-comparison-slider class=\"img-comparison-slider-zoomable\" style=\"max-width:100%\"><figure slot=\"first\" class=\"before\"><img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://docs.nanos.world/img/blog/2025-april/shadows-torch-bef.webp\" style=\"transform-origin:top left\"><figcaption style=\"bottom:10px\">Before (Dynamic Shadows)</figcaption></figure><figure slot=\"second\" class=\"after\"><img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://docs.nanos.world/img/blog/2025-april/shadows-torch-aft.webp\" style=\"transform-origin:top left\"><figcaption style=\"bottom:10px\">After (Contact Shadows)</figcaption></figure></img-comparison-slider><p class=\"media-legend\">Performance Comparison when near the Torches</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"actor-ticks\">Actor Ticks<a href=\"https://docs.nanos.world/pt-BR/blog/april-2025#actor-ticks\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Actor Ticks\" title=\"Direct link to Actor Ticks\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Also, I've found that in the game tick, there were a lot of actors and components ticking every frame, even though they were not being active or being used, and this was taking some considerable percentage of the main thread frame time.</p>\n<p>Just to mention a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weapons</strong> had several Ticks enabled all the time, to calculate things like blood debounce or the firing cadence, and it has been improved by only activating them when we have the weapon picked up.</li>\n<li><strong>Pawns</strong> (Character &amp;
