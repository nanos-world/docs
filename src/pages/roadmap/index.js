							title="üèÉ Improved Character Gameplay"
							image="/roadmap/gasp.webp"
							description={<>
								Our current character is still based on the old UE4 Mannequin, and it definitely shows its age. The animations are outdated, the native meshes aren't great, and the overall quality doesn't set a good standard. There are also a lot of missing or unfinished mechanics, like proning, and some existing animations just don't feel right. Movement needs a serious rework too as it's not as fluid or satisfying as it should be.
								<br/><br/>
								With the upgrade to Unreal Engine 5.5, we're looking into integrating the new Game Animation Sample Project (GASP) from Unreal. It brings a more modern and polished animation setup that could help us improve overall gameplay feel. We'll be studying how we can make use of it while refining our character's mechanics to ensure everything is smooth, responsive, and up to the level we want.

								We are aiming towards an open-world map that's not just there for show but actually fun to play in. The idea is to create a space that serves as the foundation for multiple game-modes, making it a versatile and also engaging.
								<br/><br/>
								It'll also act as our main testing ground, allowing us to fine-tune all the game's features in a real gameplay setting. Our goal is to make a world that feels dynamic, adaptable, and packed with opportunities for different kinds of experiences.

								We've already got a boat entity in place, and now it's time to take things to the skies with an airplane. This means developing proper aircraft mechanics and making sure they can be fully customizable through scripting.
								<br/><br/>
								Since it's all based on physics simulation, we won't need any external integrations to make it work. The focus will be on designing the entity itself, fine-tuning its mechanics, and exposing the necessary systems so that it can be customized and expanded by the community. Modders will be able to bring in their own custom meshes and assets, making it as flexible and moddable as possible.

								As well with the Airplane entity, another important gameplay feature is bringing helicopters into the game. While similar in concept, helicopters come with their own unique mechanics, requiring specialized flight physics and controls. Just like with airplanes, we'll make sure everything is fully scriptable and customizable, allowing modders to create their own helicopter models, tweak flight behavior, and add custom assets.

								<br/><br/>

								Game-modes are the core of the game. Without them, there's nothing for players to really dive into. That's why we're making sure we have solid, long-term game modes ready before launch. These will be the key to attracting real players and keeping the community engaged.
								<br/><br/>
								Until then, we'll keep working with modders and scripters to create content and expand what's possible. We want to give the community the tools to experiment and help shape the game first.
								<br/><br/>
								Once we have game-modes and content that are polished and fun, we'll start building hype and bringing in streamers and players to showcase the experience. The goal is to launch with exciting and replayable modes that keep players coming back for more.

								<br/><br/>
								Although we already have a functional in-game Vault system that allows players to share and download custom content, we recognize its current implementation has limitations, particularly when it comes to backend implementation and integration.
								<br/><br/>
								Our goal with this rework is to significantly improve the Vault's backend services and associated web pages. Making the process of uploading new content, managing versions and details much easier for creators to share their work with the community.

								This is a community request to improve the asset distribution. We would allow server creators to specify a CDN (Content Delivery Network) server URL for assets to be downloaded (for Asset Packs not already in the Vault).
								<br/><br/>
								Clients will then automatically use this URL to download asset files, bypassing direct downloads from the game server itself. This would not only reduce server load and improve overall server performance, but also increase download speeds for players (especially those geographically distant from the server).
								<br/><br/>

This will make the process of creating and sharing custom content much easier and more accessible to everyone.

								Parties and Lobbies are all about making it easier to play with friends. The idea is to integrate Steam's SDK to allow players to create lobbies, invite their friends, and join servers together. Instead of everyone having to find and join a server separately, you'll be able to squad up and jump in as a group.
								<br/><br/>
								This feature would improve the social aspect of the game, making multiplayer sessions more fun and accessible. We'll be looking into how best to implement it while ensuring it works smoothly with our existing systems.

								We're planning to introduce breakable entities using Unreal Engine's Chaos Destruction system. We already had some experiments with it in the past, but we're looking to expand it further and make it a core feature of the game.
								<br/><br/>
								A challenge we will face is achieving reliable network replication of destruction events in multiplayer. Synchronizing dynamic destruction across all clients is complex and requires careful consideration. We need to ensure that all players experience the same destruction events simultaneously, and also synchronized after players reconnecting to the server.
								<br/><br/>
								Another challenge is to seamlessly incorporate this system with our existing entities, making sure they are cohesive with other existing entities such as Props.

								Right now, characters can stay underwater forever without any issues, which isn't exactly realistic. We're planning to introduce a drowning system where characters will need to come up for air. If they stay submerged too long, they'll start losing health and eventually die.
								<br/><br/>
								Of course, we want this to be flexible, so scripters will have full control over it‚Äîwhether to enable or disable it, adjust timers, or even modify how it works. This will add more depth (literally) to water-based gameplay and open up new possibilities for custom game modes.

								<br/><br/>
								Currently we already have some of these assets in the game, but we're planning to expand, improve and standardize them.
								<br/><br/>
								The idea is to have a small and optimized set of meshes that will serve as a starting point for modders and scripters to start blocking out and creating content before needing to import custom assets.

								Unreal's Metahuman is a tool that lets developers create highly realistic human characters for games and other projects. It's pretty cool because it offers detailed customization options, making characters look and move in a lifelike way.
								<br/><br/>
								We're excited about the idea of integrating Metahuman into nanos world. However, we know that supporting different skeletons can be tricky. Right now, we plan to rework our current character to be compatible with Unreal Engine 5's skeleton and new animations. As we do this, we'll study how we might bring Metahuman into the mix. It's a possibility we're keen on, but we want to make sure it fits well with our existing setup.

								However, we're focusing on enhancing our own custom solution, the Vault, which is already in place and undergoing significant improvements.
								<br/><br/>
								While Steam Workshop offers a centralized hub for user-generated content, we believe that our tailored approach with the Vault will better serve our community's specific needs.

								Asynchronous scripting is indeed a topic frequently discussed and requested by the community. Currently our scripting system is synchronous, meaning that scripts run one after the other in a single thread. This could potentially lead to performance issues if scripts take too long to execute.
								<br/><br/>
								Although we didn't see any major problems so far, we understand that asynchronous scripting could be beneficial for certain use cases. and in an ideal world, we'd love to have it, but it's a complex feature that requires careful planning and execution.
								<br/><br/>
								Currently our focus is on improving the core game experience and adding new features that will benefit the majority of players. Asynchronous scripting is a more advanced feature that would primarily benefit scripters and hosting performance. We're keeping it in mind for the future, but it's not a priority at the moment.
