The animations are outdated, the native meshes aren't great, and the overall quality doesn't set a good standard. There are also a lot of missing or unfinished mechanics, like proning, and some existing animations just don't feel right. Movement needs a serious rework too as it's not as fluid or satisfying as it should be.\n\nWith the upgrade to Unreal Engine 5.5, we're looking into integrating the new Game Animation Sample Project (GASP) from Unreal. It brings a more modern and polished animation setup that could help us improve overall gameplay feel. We'll be studying how we can make use of it while refining our character's mechanics to ensure everything is smooth, responsive, and up to the level we want.",
