### What changes?

Practically, nothing! It's still us, but under a proper name. This is a step forward in becoming a more solid and professional studio!

We will also be updating our **ToS (Terms of Service)** and **Privacy Policy** with updated details regarding UGC, monetization, and more.

We established a simple landing page where you will be able to find all the official documents and terms (soon™), as well as official contact information:

## Halloween Playtest Recap

![](/img/blog/2025-november/halloween.webp)

Our **Halloween Playtest** was awesome! We could see a drastic reduction in crashes and bugs compared to previous events, demonstrating that our stability improvements are succeeding!

The data and insights gathered during this playtest helped us a lot finding several bottlenecks and optimizations that needed to be made to improve nanos world!

Again, a huge **thank you** to everyone who jumped in, tested, and reported issues! And stay tuned that we will be hosting more events like this in the future! 🎃


### Community Creators

We also want to highlight the amazing creators who built the game-modes we played: **NegativeName**, **Wast3d**, **Antho**, **Voltaism**, **Ayanokoji**, and **olivato**.

To celebrate your contribution, you have all been awarded the **Halloween 2025 Badge**! It's already visible on your profiles pages!

## Unreal Engine 5.7

![](/img/blog/2025-november/ue-57-banner.webp)

<MediaLegend>Unreal Engine 5.7 Announcement</MediaLegend>

After struggling a bit fixing some breaking changes from this update, we have successfully updated nanos world to **Unreal Engine 5.7**! 🚀

We were previously on version 5.5, so this update brings a lot of rendering and animation improvements that we are excited to have! You can see the full [Unreal Engine 5.7 release notes](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/news/unreal-engine-5-7-is-now-available) for all the details.

~~We are currently waiting for the first hotfix to release before we push the new nanos world version.~~ At the time of writing, Unreal Engine **5.7.1** has been just released! We will be testing and pushing the update in the next days!


### New Video Settings

With Unreal **5.7**, we are also exposing new settings to control new rendering features, such as `MegaLights` and the new Anti-Aliasing `SMAA`.


## File Validator Rework

![](/img/blog/2025-november/validating.webp)

<MediaLegend>Validating Files while connecting to a server</MediaLegend>

Our **Files Validator** has been completely reworked. It now validates local files much **faster** (using all your CPU threads) when starting a server and caching all client files, or when joining a server and checking for updates.

Additionally, it now properly removes any **outdated files** that were deleted on the server (for both Packages and Assets). This fixes crashes caused by leftover, old assets persisting on the client side.


## Unified Package Cache

The client's **Packages Cache** folder is now unified across all servers. This means if you connect to another server using the same package, it will **reuse** the existing cache. No more unnecessary re-downloads!

This also greatly improves the experience for **P2P** servers. Previously, these servers had to re-download all scripting files every time the server started (as they generated random fake IPs to connect).


## File Transfer Rework

The **File Transfer System** has been completely overhauled to be far more robust and stable utilizing the inline networking sockets system.

A new fair **scheduling algorithm** keeps track of all connected clients in a queue and distributes files uniformly between them. This ensures everyone downloads files evenly, fixing cases where some players were stuck at 0 B/s.

Furthermore, we can now transmit files of **any size** (the old 256 MB limit has been removed).

To be able to broadly test this new system, this is now the default system for file transmission. The HTTP transfer method can still be used but must be manually enabled in the settings.


## New Status Page

![](/img/blog/2025-november/status.webp)

<MediaLegend>Status Page showing all running services</MediaLegend>

We've created a new **Status Page** that monitors the uptime of all our services and APIs. If anything goes down, we'll know about it there!

<ReferenceLink href="https://status.nanos-world.com">🕑 Status Page Dashboard</ReferenceLink>


## Performance++

We are always working hard to make nanos world as efficient as possible. This month, we focused on greatly improving our **Network Authority** algorithm, making it much more efficient by iterating only the Network Authority Distributed list on every tick.

We also optimized many **UIs** on both the main menu and the escape menu, making them far more rendering-efficient, and reducing hitches when opening/loading them.


## Profile Badges

![](/img/blog/2025-november/badges.webp)

<MediaLegend>In-game Badges List</MediaLegend>

We added a new **Badges** section to your in-game Profile! You can now view all your earned Badges (such as from the Halloween event) directly in the game.

We will start adding more Badges for various events, contributions and funny things soon!

:::tip

Soon™ everyone will earn the Alpha Tester Badge for being part of our testing program since the early days!

## In-Game Notifications!

![](/img/blog/2025-november/notifications.webp)

<MediaLegend>In-Game Notifications</MediaLegend>

We moved the notifications system from the main menu to in-game as well!

It is now possible to programmatically show notifications to players via the integrated system while they are playing: <MethodReference type="StaticClass" class_name="Client" method="ShowNotification" show_class_name is_static />.

It will also display **FATAL** and **ERROR** logs that may occur during gameplay.


## Debug Improvements

### Profiling Stack

Our **Profiling List** now shows the **Stack Hierarchy** of all calls, allowing for better debugging of what is causing any performance issues.

### Profiling Entities Network

Our **Entities Network Stats Information** profiling now shows how many entities are spawned for each Class, and whether they are actively transmitting data or inactive.

## Misc

### VOIP/Fire Events

We've changed the behavior of <EventReference type="Class" class_name="Player" event="VOIP" /> and <EventReference type="Class" class_name="Weapon" event="Fire" /> events. They now trigger on the client first. This allows for better handling of the client-side actions triggering those events, allowing listening to those calls before they are sent to the server.


### New `max_send_rate` Setting

We added a new `Config.toml` setting: [`max_send_rate`](/docs/next/core-concepts/server-manual/server-configuration#settings-detailed). This allows server owners to control the **maximum network bandwidth** per connected player, effectively limiting download speeds if necessary.


### Suggest/Report Button

![](/img/blog/2025-november/report-button.webp)

<MediaLegend>Report Button on Main Menu and Escape Menu</MediaLegend>

We've added a new button that lets you rapidly submit a message to our backend. We added this during the Playtest to ensure people who weren't connected to our Discord still had a fast way to report bugs.

<MediaLegend>Report Popup</MediaLegend>


### HUB Server

We added a new *experimental* section on the Main Menu to display a **"HUB"** server that you can rapidly connect to. In the future, this server will host a custom, simple game-mode that allows players to join and socialize while waiting for other servers to start.


### Updated Roadmap

We have updated our public Roadmap and added a bunch of new features, to mention a few: **Anti-Cheat**, **Monetization Tools**, **Culling System**, and more that we already released! Check it out:

### Steam SDK update

We've updated the Steam SDK to the latest 1.62 version.


## Conclusion

Since we skipped October's blog to focus on Halloween, this blog wraps up the last two months!

We were thrilled to officially formalize our identity as **Go Horse Studios**, marking a major milestone in our journey as a professional game studio!

The **Halloween Playtest** was fundamental in identifying key bottlenecks, leading to significant fixes and improvements in our **File Validator** and **File Transfer** systems!

And finally we are moving to the newer **Unreal Engine 5.7** version, which brings a lot of new features and improvements to the table that we will be able to use and integrate!

A huge thank you to everyone who joined the playtest, reported issues and created content, you literally shape the game! We're excited for the next events!

Thanks for being part of this journey. See you in-game! 💙
