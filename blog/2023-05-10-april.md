**Vehicle Health, Docs++, Lean Assets, Utility Classes & more!**

![](/img/blog/2023-april/april-news.webp)

Tune in for a roundup of the latest updates from April!

<!--truncate-->


## Vehicle Damage System

This update is one of the most coolest addition we are getting! Now <Classes.VehicleWheeled />s have a new Damage & Health system, they can be damaged, and if the health reaches zero, the vehicle explodes, losing its tires and turning into burnt!

<VideoExternal path="/blog/2023-april/vehicle-explosion.webm" />

This behavior can be configured with the new method: [`Vehicle.SetExplosionSettings()`](/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/vehicle-wheeled#function-setexplosionsettings).

:::info

We will still keep improving and adding new features to this system, like allowing more customization and stages of destruction.

## Vehicle Flatten Tires

In addition to the Health System, Vehicles can now have their tires exploded when getting damaged!

<VideoExternal path="/blog/2023-april/vehicles-tire.webm" />

Also it can be manually scripted with a new method [`Vehicle.SetTireFlat(index, true)`](/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/vehicle-wheeled#function-settireflat).

:::tip

To be able to make it work, each Wheel Bone must have a **Physics Body Collision** in the Vehicle Skeleton Asset.

## Docs Improvements

Our documentation has gone through many improvements and fixes this month, it's getting increasingly automated and robust!

Also worth mentioning we managed to fix the biggest problem being fixed of links pointing to wrong anchors in the page.


### Essentials Concepts

We created a new Essential Guide Concepts, which goes over all the important and basic concepts of nanos world for newcomers to get a better onboarding to get started scripting and modding!

This is the new initial guide everyone should read first!

<ReferenceLink href="getting-started/essential-concepts">Essentials Concepts</ReferenceLink>


### Better Examples

We implemented a new examples format that is automatically displayed under each function/event in a dropdown and also grouped in the *# Examples* section of each page:

### Standard Lua Classes

We added a new section to the docs listing all Standard Lua Libraries [string](/docs/next/scripting-reference/standard-libraries/string), [math](/docs/next/scripting-reference/standard-libraries/math) and [table](/docs/next/scripting-reference/standard-libraries/table), documenting it's methods and examples! To help newcomers learning the basics of Lua!

### Functions Hint Format

Now Function Type will have a ToolTip telling what are the arguments this function will be called with, with detailed description of each!

### Tables Hint Format

Also tables now have a ToolTip as well describing the format of the table expected/returned!

![](/img/blog/2023-april/table-format.webp)


### Enums Usage

We developed a feature which automatically identifies everywhere an Enum is used by the API and lists them all under each Enum definition:

## Log Files

Log files are now organized in folders and separated by date, with each session creating a new log file created for better organization.

On server a new folder called `.logs/` exists on root to contain all files:

## Server Lean Assets

This is probably one of the best things we are introducing for server owners! Now it is possible to start servers without the need to install Asset Packs on them!

Asset files were never needed on server side, but until last update we still needed to download it from Vault as we could have Map Packages inside of it.

But as we got a new Map Package system and don't need Asset files at all on server, we are adding a new command line flag `--use_vault_assets_lean`!

This flag will tell the server to do not download any Asset Pack (if not already installed), but instead will just download the .toml of it and load the Asset Pack in a *Lean* mode! Players will still download all assets from the Vault as usual.


## Utility & Native Tables

We reorganized our Utility Classes, and got a new <UtilityClasses.NanosTable /> Utility Class! This class will contain utility methods for dealing with Lua tables!

Also we are expanding some native class such as <BasicType.String /> by adding custom helper methods to it, like [`StartsWith()`](/docs/next/scripting-reference/standard-libraries/string#function-startswith), [`Trim()`](/docs/next/scripting-reference/standard-libraries/string#function-trim) and [`EndsWith()`](/docs/next/scripting-reference/standard-libraries/string#function-endswith), which can be called on the strings natively like:

```lua
local my_string = "Hello Mom!"
local starts = my_string:StartsWith("Hello")
```

:::tip

All custom methods added to native classes will be in `PascalCase`. And can be differentiated in the docs by the icons <NativeType.Native /> or <NativeType.NotNative />.

## Improved Escape Menu

We continued improving our Escape Menu, and now it integrates with Vault displaying the current playing Map and Game Mode, and also displays the Server Logo as well!

## Blueprints Parameters

We improved even more our Blueprints integration implementation by now allowing **ANY** Unreal Struct to be passed through parameters to it!

It works by dynamically iterating and parsing all struct properties and retrieving those values from a Lua table passed as parameter.

The opposite is also true. Passing an Unreal Struct as parameter to Lua will parse it to Lua table! It works for both Native and Custom Structs!

:::note

Some Unreal Structs like `FTransform` or `FSlateBrush` have some complex parameters and also "fake" Setter/Getters which don't allow proper parsing.

For other structs like that we still need to implement custom parses to/from Lua. If you get more Structs like that and want to be integrated, let us know!

:::


## New Debug Settings

We added a new section to the Debug Settings, allowing us to perform tests using fake/simulated network conditions, which help us (devs) and also scripters to test how the game will behave with players with bad or poor connections!

We can simulate high ping, limited bandwidth or even packet loss with that!

![](/img/blog/2023-april/debug-settings.webp)


## Multi Clients

We finally solved all the problems with launching multi clients instances! Now you can launch several game instances to test the multiplayer aspect of your script without any impediment or being disconnected/kicked due file transfer problems!

![](/img/blog/2023-april/multiclient.webp)


## New Cache System

We implemented a new Caching System! It's super faster compared to the old system, which means loading times will be very decreased!

The **Caching System** is a system that works by speeding up loading times by caching the assets hashes locally, so the client/server can just verify it without needing to recalculate the hash for the whole file every time we join or open a server (hashing a file is a really slow operation).

The old Cache system worked by creating one file per asset under the `Assets/.cache/` folder with the cache information. But this caused a lot of problems because it was slow to access the OS File System to access each file, and also zipping the Assets folder were really slow because of the amount of .cache files existing.

But now we improved this system by having only one .cache file per Asset Pack! This makes everything **super** faster and loading times are boosted now!

## File Client Side

Now the <Classes.File /> Class is also Client Side! Allowing scripters to create and access persistent files on client side too!

The file access on client side is sandboxed and only allowed inside the `Packages/127.0.0.1/.transient/` folder, it's not allowed to access any external file or folder of that, for security.

This small change allows many other possibilities by having cached and custom saved files stored locally on clients!


## Misc Improvements

We also got a bunch of smaller and miscellaneous improvements!

### File Character Limit

We managed to rework our internal access to File System by fixing a problem that didn't allow files/assets to have more than 240 characters on Windows, causing errors when they were tried to be loaded!


### Character Interaction

<Classes.Character />s now always calculate interacting objects, even if aimed. Improving the overall gameplay feeling.


### Loading Screen Time

The overall game loading time extremely improved this month! With the addition of the new cache system and also with several internal improvements we made, we went from the minimum hardcoded time taken of 3-5 seconds down to 0.5 seconds! Joining servers is super fast now!


### Mouse Events

Now Mouse events will always trigger, even if a WebUI/Widget has focus in the front!


### Canvas Screen Position

Our <Classes.Canvas /> Class got several improvements allowing it to be positioned on screen with a new [`screen_position`](/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/canvas#constructor-default-constructor). constructor parameter, and new methods [`Resize()`](/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/canvas#function-resize), [`SetScreenPosition()`](/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/canvas#function-setscreenposition) and [`SetAutoResize()`](/docs/next/scripting-reference/classes/canvas#function-setautoresize).

This allows Canvas rendering to screen to be much more customized!


## Conclusion

In conclusion, April has been an exciting month for nanos world, with significant progress made in improving the onboarding experience for newcomers. The various enhancements in documentation and new guides will make all the difference for those starting out.

The new feature allowing servers to start without the need to download assets is also a game-changer, enabling easier ways to automate server installation and start-ups.

Moreover, we also resolved several issues that have been bothering everyone, including connecting multiple client instances simultaneously and a bug preventing the game/server from loading assets with long paths on Windows. Not to mention the Mouse Input Events not triggering when having WebUI focused, which was a recurring complain and now is completely solved!

Overall, this was a month of great possibilities and new features being added, once again thank you so much for all the support! See you next month! 😁
