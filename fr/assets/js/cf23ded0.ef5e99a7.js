Decals are Materials that are projected onto meshes in your level, including Static Meshes and Skeletal Meshes. You can load any `.jpg` from disk during runtime and use it as parameter in your Decal Material!\\n\\nAs Decals are inherited from Actors, you can change it\'s location, rotation, attach it or call any method from [Base Actor](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor) on it!\\n\\n\\n## New Class: [Billboard](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/billboard)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/billboard.jpg)\\n\\nWe\'ve added another new class to spawning **Billboards**! A Billboard is a 2D Material that will be rendered always facing the camera. It\'s possible to use all custom methods from Paintable as well and spawning custom textures on it. You can tweak it\'s material properties with [Base Paintable](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/paintable) or even use a material of your own.\\n\\nAs Billboards are inherited from Actors, you can change it\'s location, rotation, attach it or call any method from [Base Actor](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor) on it!\\n\\n\\n## New Class: [Melee](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/melee)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/melee.jpg)\\n\\nWe are getting a brand new very-requested class: **Melee**! The Melee is coming to replace the former **Item** class.\\n\\n**Melee** is a new Class (which works exactly as the old **Item**) but now with ability to attack with it. It is possible to add custom animations, a cooldown and tweak the damage of it. The attack physics is procedurally based on the animation, this means you can stab, slash or even smash things only by changing the animation and then the hit will be based on that!\\n\\nThe results are quite fun, the hit/damage also affects the environment dynamically \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/november/melee.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n## Scripting Improvements\\n\\nWe\'ve listen to your demand and we\'re finally bringing long-awaited new amazing scripting features!\\n\\n### Real Hot Reload\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/hotreload.jpg)\\n\\nAfter several requests, we\'ve started implementing a real Hot Reload feature!\\n\\nThe real **Hot Reloading** is an amazing feature which allows you loading new scripting code without needing to lose all the current memory state of your Packages. It works by loading the scripting files over the current running Lua VM.\\n\\nCurrently it works by manually triggering it in the console:\\n\\n```bash\\npackage hotreload [PACKAGE_NAME|all]\\n```\\n\\nThis will update the clients with the newer files version and load the `Index.lua` files from the packages. It will keep the current memory state of the packages as it is. It will also unsubscribe from all registered Events in that package.\\n\\nIn the future, it would be possible to add a real-time checker to automatically update the modified files after saving them.\\n\\n\\n### Extending Classes\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/extending.jpg)\\n\\nA new cool feature that is being added is Extending and Inheriting nanos world Classes. *This is still experimental and we want to collect your feedback and find remaining bugs.*\\n\\nIt is now possible to **Add new Methods** to nanos world Classes, **Override existing Methods** and even **Override __index and __newindex**.\\n\\nAdding a new method to a class is easy like this:\\n\\n```lua\\n-- Adding a new method \'AddScore\' to Player class\\nfunction Player:AddScore(score)\\n    self:SetValue(\\"score\\", self:GetValue(\\"score\\", 0) + score)\\nend\\n\\n-- Using it\\nmy_player:AddScore(10)\\n```\\n\\nRead the full documentation [here](/docs/core-concepts/scripting/extending-classes).\\n\\n\\n## New View Mode: TopDown\\n\\nWe created a new native View Mode: **TopDown**!\\n\\nThis ViewMode allows you to fully control Characters from a TopDown perspective.\\n\\nWith just a single line:\\n\\n```lua\\nmy_character:SetViewMode(ViewMode.TopDown)\\n```\\n\\nnanos world becomes a completely different game, the mouse is now a crosshair which the Character aims to. Mechanics of picking up Weapons, grabbing Props and interacting with stuff was slightly modified to work with the ViewMode. Also driving is fully supported as well! \ud83e\udd29\\n\\nIt also is possible to dynamically change the view mode and switch between them during game-play and also tweak settings such as camera distance and so on.\\n\\n<video controls=\\"true\\" allowfullscreen=\\"true\\">\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/blog/november/top-down.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n## New Camera Methods\\n\\nPlayer got a bunch of new Camera methods: `Player:SetCameraSocketOffset()`, `Player:SetCameraArmLength()`.\\n\\nAnd also ability to detach and attach it to other actors (\ud83d\udc40 including Props): `Player:AttachCameraTo()` and `Player:ResetCamera()`. It will attach including a Camera SpringArm component!\\n\\nNote: **Spectate** methods from **Client** has been moved to **Player**: `Player:Spectate()`.\\n\\n\\n## [TextRender](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/text-render) on Server Side\\n\\nNow the Class `TextRender` now can be spawned on Server Side as well!\\n\\n\\n## Other Changes\\n\\nBesides the major topics covered here, we\'ve got several other new features which were been added during the month:\\n\\n- Added a new method for Character: `Character:Follow()` which will make the AI follow other actor.\\n- Added a new Utils method: `NanosUtils.Benchmark()` which will take a function as parameter and test the performance of it.\\n- Now `Subscribe` will return the callback function (which can be used to Unsubscribe afterwards).\\n- Fixed tons of bugs, detailed information can be found in the Discord Changelog channel.\\n\\n\\n## Unreal Engine 5\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5.jpg)\\n\\nLastly, it is already known we have a big objective of porting nanos world to Unreal Engine 5. Personally this is something I wanted to do as soon as possible because Unreal Engine 5 features are amazing, not to mention the publicity and marketing bonuses we would get for nanos world.\\n\\nIn this month, we decided to give a try: we tested porting nanos world to Unreal 5, at first we had some problems because of some Unreal modules have been completely renamed or even removed. And also we got some Unreal methods deprecated by the newer version, so we needed to update them and even reimplement some small stuff.\\n\\nCurrently Unreal Engine 4 uses PhysX physics and in Unreal 5 all the Physics Engine have been replaced by [Unreal\'s Chaos](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/PhysicsFeatures/ChaosVSPhysxOverview/), which is a new Engine replacing the NVIDIA\'s PhysX.\\n\\nThis made us need to disable Vehicles for this test, as Unreal vehicles are very dependent on the PhysX engine and I would need to reimplement them using the new Chaos API for vehicles (I believe that our Vehicles API will need to change a bit as well once we fully update it).\\n\\nBut after half of dozen adaptions and disabled Vehicles, the results were surprisingly good! nanos world worked on Unreal Engine 5! Personally I got very happy and proud that the biggest problems I had was updating deprecate methods and updating some Unreal modules, thanks to the architecture developed so far in nanos world!\\n\\n\\n### Graphical Results\\n\\nnanos world on Unreal Engine 5 is beautiful, joying with Lumen and Global Illumination is really fun!\\n\\nThere were some graphical artifacts (such as changing the time of day too fast causing a delay/ghosting effect), but I believe they will improve them for the final Unreal Engine 5 version.\\n\\nCheck it out some screenshots taken during the tests trying the Global Illumination and Lumen:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5-outside.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5-inside-gas-01.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5-inside-gas-02.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5-inside-flash-01.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5-inside-flash-02.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blog/november/ue5-inside-flash-03.jpg)\\n\\n\\n### Stability\\n\\nUnfortunately the stability was extremely bad. It didn\'t surprise me too much as Unreal Engine 5 is on Early Access, so bugs and crashes would happen. Several random crashes occurred during gameplay, I could notice mostly of them were caused by the new Chaos Engine (related to Physics).\\n\\n\\n### What now?\\n\\nI was really happy in being able to port nanos world to Unreal Engine 5, this attempt made us be sure that this would be possible. But I decided that currently is not time yet. During the tests we had several crashes (random ones, related to the low-level of Unreal, mainly coming from Chaos Engine and from Water) that made us conclude that is better to wait a better stable version because it makes nanos world really unplayable. Those random crashes are extremely bad as sometimes it\'s hard to know if it\'s my or Unreal\'s fault.\\n\\nFortunately, with this we could prove ourselves that nanos world will, when the time comes, be compatible and updated to Unreal Engine 5!"},{"id":"alpha-released","metadata":{"permalink":"/fr/blog/alpha-released","editUrl":"https://github.com/nanos-world/docs/edit/master/blog/2021-11-03-alpha-released.md","source":"@site/i18n/fr/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2021-11-03-alpha-released.md","title":"October: Alpha released!","description":"We proudly present...","date":"2021-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"3 novembre 2021","tags":[{"label":"updates","permalink":"/fr/blog/tags/updates"}],"readingTime":10.955,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel T.

Our community has grown a lot and it\'s lovely to see how nice and friendly it is becoming \ud83e\udd70!\\n\\nThe Playtest session in the Sunday was amazing! We were able to test the stability of the game very well. I can say that most of the crashes we had were related to external integration issues (WebUI or Unreal itself), which shows a great maturity of our Core system. I think about doing it more often, it was a lot of fun playing Halloween mode and testing the community game-modes!\\n\\nFrom now on, all updates will start to be versioned (finally!), small updates/non break-changes will get a PATCH version and break-changing will get a MINOR version.\\n\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nThe following changelog contains all features since last officially announced release 0.73.0. Many of the next items were already in the bleeding-edge branch.\\n\\n::: <iframe class=\\"steam-widget\\" src=\\"https://store.steampowered.com/widget/1686450/\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" width=\\"620\\" height=\\"190\\" loading=\\"lazy\\" mark=\\"crwd-mark\\"></iframe>\\n\\n\\n## Materials\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/material.jpg)\\n\\nNow nanos world supports Materials Assets! \ud83c\udfa8\\n\\nThis means you can configure your own materials in your Assets.toml and reference them using [Paintable](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/paintable) methods!\\n\\nThe function `:SetDefaultMaterial()` has been replaced with `:SetMaterial()`. You can see a list of all built-in Materials read to use [here](/docs/next/assets-modding/default-asset-pack/default-materials).\\n\\nAlso it is now possible to get the WebUI material and set it to any surface (read more below)!\\n\\nSome existing methods are suffering a rework due that, e.g. [Pickables](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/pickable) got a new method `:SetCrosshairMaterial()`, so you can set the Crosshair from a Material (and not from a predefined list anymore), also all old Crosshair have been converted into materials which you can find [here](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/pickable#list-of-crosshairs-materials-included-in-default-asset-pack).\\n\\n\\n## Improved WebUI\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/webui.jpg)\\n\\nThe [WebUI](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/webui) received several improvements, including the ability to run HTML5 Audio and Videos! \ud83d\udcfd\\n\\n:::caution\\n\\nWe are using a Beta version of Ultralight, which supports Audio and Video, crashes **WILL** happen, also the Audio is currently 2D only. Ultralight is working on a solution so I can implement 3D audio.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThe **WebUI** constructor received some new parameters: **is_transparent**, **auto_resize**, **width** and **height**. Width and Height will only be used if Auto Resize is **OFF**, this is useful if you want to spawn a WebUI to use as Material to any surface (and don\'t want it to be the size of the screen).\\n\\nAlso it received new methods: [:SetFreeze()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/webui#setfreeze), [:Resize()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/webui#resize) and [:SetAutoResize()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/webui#setautoresize).\\n\\nA new Searcher has been added onto it, improving how it can load your .html files, they are now looked in the following order:\\n1. Relative to `current-file-path/`\\n2. Relative to `current-package/Client/`\\n3. Relative to `current-package/`\\n4. Relative to `Packages/`\\n\\nIt is now possible to spawn a Material from a WebUI, which renders dynamic and automatically into **any** surface: `:SetMaterialFromWebUI()` (method from Actors).\\n\\n\\n## Actors\\n\\nNew additions for [Actors](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor):\\n\\n* Added new method for all actors: [:SetLifeSpan(time)](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor#setlifespan) which will automatically destroy this actor after `time` seconds.\\n* Added new method for all actors: [:IsBeingDestroyed()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor#isbeingdestroyed) which will return if this actor is being destroyed (useful to check from inside other Events such as `Drop` or `Ungrab`).\\n* Added new parameter for all actors [:AttachTo()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor#attachto) method: `lifespan_when_detached`, which will destroy the actor after `time` seconds after it\'s detached.\\n* Now event [TakeDamage](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor#takedamage) has a new argument: `causer` (the object/actor which caused the damage). Also added new damage types: `RunOverVehicle` and `RunOverProp`.\\n* Now event [Hit](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor#hit) has new arguments: `impact_force`, `normal_impulse`, `impact_location` and `velocity`.\\n* Now [:SetLocation()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor#setlocation) will try to find the better spot to teleport the Actor (to avoid collisions).\\n\\n\\n## Character\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/character.jpg)\\n\\nNew additions for [Characters](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character):\\n\\n**Character Methods additions/improvements:**\\n* Added several new Getters from it\'s properties.\\n* Added [:SetDamageMultiplier()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#setdamagemultiplier) change the damage multiplier depending on the bone damaged.\\n* Added [:SetHiddenBone()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#sethiddenbone) to make invisible any part of the body.\\n* Added [:SetJumpZVelocity()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#setjumpzvelocity) to make the character jump higher.\\n* Improved [:PlayAnimation()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#playanimation) got new parameters (blend times, loop and play rate), and now it supports loading any type of animation (Montage or Sequence).\\n* Removed `:SetInitialLocation()`, it has been replaced with [:Respawn()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#respawn).\\n\\n**Character Events additions/improvements:**\\n* Added [AttemptEnterVehicle](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#attemptentervehicle) called when Character tries to enter a vehicle, returns false to prevent it.\\n* Added [AttemptLeaveVehicle](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#attemptleavevehicle) called when Character tries to leave a vehicle, returns false to prevent it.\\n* Added [AttemptReload](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#attemptreload) called when Character tries to reload it\'s weapon, returns false to prevent it.\\n* Added [Interact](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#interact) called when Characters tries to Pick Up a Pickable or Grab a Prop.\\n* Added [Highlight](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character#highlight) called when Characters looks at a Prop or Pickable being able to pick up it.\\n\\nSome Characters animations have been renamed from `AM_` to `A_` in the Default Asset Pack (as they are not Montages anymore). Also lots of new Animations have been added.\\n\\n\\n## Weapons\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/weapon.jpg)\\n\\nNew additions for [Weapons](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/weapon):\\n\\n**Weapon Methods additions/improvements:**\\n* Added several new Getters from it\'s properties.\\n* Added [:SetRecoil()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/weapon#setrecoil) how much the weapon recoils physically.\\n* Added [:SetWallbangSettings()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/weapon#setwallbangsettings) configure if bullets wallbangs walls.\\n* Added [:SetAnimationFire()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/weapon#setanimationfire) animation on Weapon Skeletal when firing.\\n* Added [:SetSoundFireLastBullets()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/weapon#setsoundfirelastbullets) sound when `N` last bullets are remaining in the clip.\\n* Improved [:SetAnimationReload()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/weapon#setanimationreload) now has `play_rate` parameter.\\n\\n**Additional stuff:**\\n* Now weapons are hidden when Characters are driving.\\n* Added sounds of Shell Dropping & hitting the ground for the built-in Shell particles (this is a procedural and 100% precise sound \ud83d\ude09).\\n* Added sounds when picking up or dropping weapons, also it will slightly throw the weapon to the front when dropping it.\\n\\n\\n## Grenades\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/grenade.jpg)\\n\\nAll Properties from [Grenades](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/grenade) have been deprecated, now access must be done through Methods.\\n\\nWe\'ve added a special Particle for Grenades `nanos-world::P_Grenade_Special` which will explode different particles depending on the ground the grenade is. I.e. will explode a \\"grass explosion\\" particle if grenade is over a grass surface, and a \\"water explosion\\" particle if it\'s under water. **Note:** This particle only works for Grenades.\\n\\n\\n## Sounds\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/sound.jpg)\\n\\nNew additions for [Sounds](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/sound):\\n\\nNow it is possible to load `.ogg` sounds at runtime! You can store them in any Package or Asset Pack and load it using our new pattern for `SpecialPath` (`assets///asset-pack-name/path.ogg` or `package///package-name/path.ogg`).\\n\\nAdded `loop_mode` parameter to constructor (can loop any sound forever now).\\n\\nAlso, it is possible to pass `.ogg` using the SpecialPath in any Sound parameter.\\n\\n**Sound Methods additions/improvements:**\\n* Added [:GetDuration()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/sound#getduration).\\n* Improved [:FadeIn()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/sound#fadein) and [:FadeOut()](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/sound#fadeout) parameters.\\n\\n\\n## Input\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/input.jpg)\\n\\nAdded a new class: [Input](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/input)!\\n\\nNow you can control, create and customize KeyBindings in a proper way! Example:\\n\\n```lua\\n-- Registers the binding_name \'SpawnMenu\' with default key \'Q\'\\n-- This will add \'SpawnMenu\' to user KeyBinding Settings automatically\\nInput.Register(\\"SpawnMenu\\", \\"Q\\")\\n\\n-- Subscribes for Pressing the key\\nInput.Bind(\\"SpawnMenu\\", InputEvent.Pressed, function()\\n    -- Opens the Spawn Menu\\nend)\\n\\n-- Subscribes for Releasing the key\\nInput.Bind(\\"SpawnMenu\\", InputEvent.Released, function()\\n    -- Closes the Spawn Menu\\nend)\\n```\\n\\n\\n## HTTP\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/http.jpg)\\n\\nAdded a new class: [HTTP](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/http)!\\n\\nNow we have a proper standalone class for making HTTP requests. Is also features Async HTTP requests (and thread safe!)\\n\\n\\n## Performance Optimization\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/performance.jpg)\\n\\nWe have worked hard on performance techniques for Alpha update. Here\'s the highlights:\\n\\n* Now Basic Structs [Vector](/docs/scripting-reference/utility-classes/vector) and [Rotator](/docs/scripting-reference/utility-classes/rotator) are automatically compressed when sending through the Network. Reducing it\'s size up to 90% in the best case! This was a great gain for network use.\\n* A new setting was added `Profiling` which you can enable with `--profiling` on server and in Settings on Client. This will log all the time elapsed to run operations/scripting events and some other stuff in the Console.\\n* Now HTTP requests (a.k.a. downloading files when joining a server) are automatically compressed, which may reduce the network usage when downloading big files!\\n* Now Actors which are very far or not on screen will be synchronized/updated half the time to improve performance. We still want to tweak it and make it more aggressive on some cases.\\n* The Assets Loading system have been reworked and is much faster now.\\n* Small [Props](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/prop) (radius < 200) will not collide with players or dynamic objects anymore. Also Bigger props will have CCD disabled by default (which drastically improved performance), this can be enabled in the Prop constructor.\\n* Now VOIP uses Steam system, which provides a great compression and also custom settings through Shift+Tab menu.\\n* Several improvements were made on our low-level Lua code to boost scripting performance.\\n\\n\\n## Server\\n\\nNew additions to [Server](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/server) static class:\\n\\n* Added new console command: `map [MAP_NAME]` to change the game map, this will also reload all packages and reconnect all players (like restarting the server).\\n* Added new methods [Server.GetVersion()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/server#getversion), [Server.GetIP()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/server#getip), [Server.GetPort()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/server#getport), [Server.GetQueryPort()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/server#getqueryport) and several missing getters.\\n\\n\\n## Client\\n\\nNew additions to [Client](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client) static class:\\n\\n* New parameters have been added to [Client.SetCameraLocation()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client#setcameralocation) and [Client.SetCameraRotation()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client#setcamerarotation) to enable smooth movements with camera in a certain time.\\n* New methods for drawing debug shapes in 3D world: [Client.DrawDebug...()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client#drawdebug).\\n* Changed [Client.SetHighlight()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client#sethighlight) parameters, now it takes a Enum to define how the highlight will be.\\n* Added new method [Client.SetSteamRichPresence()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client#setsteamrichpresence) to customize the message in Steam Friends list.\\n\\nNow when joining a server, a Progress Bar will be displayed in the Taskbar, and also it will Flash once the loading is done:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/progress-taskbar.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## In-game Console\\n\\nNow it is possible to access Server Console from within the game!\\n\\nIf you open it, 2 tabs will appear: **client** and **server**. You can read all server logs, and also input commands.\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nNot all logs will appear in there, only the ones outputted while you are connected to the server.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/console.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Timer\\n\\nNew additions to [Timer](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/timer):\\n\\n* Added new method: [Timer.Bind(timer_id, actor)](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/timer#bind) - this will associate a timer to an actor, when the actor is destroyed, this timer is destroyed too and will never be called.\\n* Added new method: [Timer.IsValid(timer_id)](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/timer#isvalid).\\n\\n\\n## CLI\\n\\n* Now it is possible to download multiple Assets/Packages at once with [CLI](/docs/core-concepts/server-manual/nanos-world-cli), just separate them by spaces, e.g.: `cli assets install quaternius city-park`.\\n\\n\\n## Steam Achievements\\n\\n![](/img/blog/alpha/achievements.jpg)\\n\\nWith Steam integration, we are making use of every feature possible it allows \ud83d\ude05!\\n\\nAnd this includes the **Achievements**! We are counting on the support of a talented friend [Esther](https://www.instagram.com/estherhoffmann/) who is drawing the amazing arts for them!\\n\\nLittle by little we will be creating more achievements and releasing them! We also count on your ideas for more!\\n\\n\\n## Scripting Improvements\\n\\n* Added new Searchers to [Package.Require()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/package#require), we now currently support 5 searchers, which are looked in the following order:\\n    1. Relative to `current-file-path/`\\n    2. Relative to `current-package/Client/` or `current-package/Server/` *(depending on your side)*\\n    3. Relative to `current-package/Shared/`\\n    4. Relative to `current-package/`\\n    5. Relative to `Packages/`\\n\\n* [Package.Require()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/package#require) now can be called in runtime and at any moment.\\n* [Package.RequirePackage()](/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/package#requirepackage) now will load a package as a library inside the current package, it means the package loaded will now be automatically sent to clients, and all paths it loads is relative to the package itself (and not to the one which is requiring it anymore).\\n* Verbose logs will now display the current thread ID.\\n\\n\\n## Renamed Default Packages\\n\\nThe default Packages `NanosWorldWeapons` and `NanosWorldVehicles` were renamed to `nanos-world-weapons` and `nanos-world-vehicles`, following the new correct pattern for Packages and Assets names. Including them now should be made like `Package.RequirePackage(\\"nanos-world-weapons\\")`, the usage keeps the same (`NanosWorldWeapons.AK47()`).\\n\\n\\n## General Changes\\n\\n* [Cable](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/cable) got new methods: `:GetAttachedStartTo()` and `:GetAttachedEndTo()` to get if it\'s attached at any end.\\n* [Player](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/player) got new methods: `:SetVOIPVolume()`, `:GetSteamID()`,\\n* [Pickables](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/pickable) got new events: `ReleaseUse`, `PullUse` when Character pulls or releases its usage (i.e. trigger for weapons)\\n* Improved the way the interact trigger enables for [Pickables](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/pickable) and [Props](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/prop).\\n* [Trigger](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/trigger) got new method: `:ForceOverlapChecking()` which will checks for overlaps in the game thread and immediately dispatch events.\\n* Added new methods for [Quaternions](/docs/scripting-reference/utility-classes/quaternion) (+, -, Normalize).\\n* Added new method for generating a random [Rotator](/docs/scripting-reference/utility-classes/rotator): `Rotator.Random()`.\\n* Added lots of new Sounds, Animations, Props, Meshes in the Default Asset Pack.\\n* Added Steam Login.\\n* All .config files had it\'s `tabs` replaced with `spaces`.\\n* `.GetPairs()` now only supports `pairs`.\\n* Added Resolutions graphic settings.\\n* Make Day button from In-game menu has been removed.\\n* Added new Splash Effects when Props or objects enter the Water.\\n* `:GetValue()` now has an additional parameter: `fallback` which will be returned if the value doesn\'t exist.\\n* Probably many other things that were being added and were forgotten \ud83d\ude1c.\\n\\n\\n## Bug Fixes\\n\\n* Fixed `World.SetFogDensity()` not working.\\n* Fixed `Client.SetCameraLocation` not working.\\n* Fixed `Actors.RotateTo()` not doing properly math.\\n* Fixed `StaticMesh.GetBounds()` not working.\\n* Fixed Cables methods being able to be called on client side.\\n* Fixed several **Character** properties not syncing.\\n* Fixed a crash when changing Map at runtime.\\n* Fixed Characters not reseting the life to `max_health` when Respawning.\\n* Fixed dead ragdolls still moving around (from `MoveTo()`).\\n* Fixed infinite recursion with `LogEntry` event.\\n* Fixed **Characters** Morph Targets not syncing.\\n* Fixed Discord custom integration not working sometimes.\\n* Fixed a crash when a player had no Steam Profile image.\\n* Fixed Server Announce checkbox being disabled when unchecked on New Game screen.\\n* Fixed a crash when destroying entities from inside `Interact` event.\\n* Fixed hell lot of other Crashes \ud83d\udca5.
