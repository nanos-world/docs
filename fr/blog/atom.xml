        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Unreal Engine 5 Preview, new Network Authority System, Store API and more</strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="network-authority-system">Network Authority System<a class="hash-link" href="#network-authority-system" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>As everyone knows, nanos world relies on a "server-less" solution for physics and other world operations. All the sync relies of sharing data between the players and replicating in each client. This approach brings several advantages and of course some drawbacks, in the advantages we can include a very lightweight server, where we have all the control over it, without needing to rely on Unreal's server executable or the way it handles the network.</p><p>In the other hand we got some challenges on how to distribute physics information and other stuff. Then in the beginning we created our first Network Authority system in which each player is responsible for sharing a specific set of entities from the server to others, similar to <a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Network-Ownership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roblox Solution</a>.</p><p>However, just like in Roblox, some problems become more noticeable when we have many players connected with many different pings. As some players will receive the "network authority" over entities faster than others, they will start sharing their location/rotation to other players while the 'old' network authority is still the authority over that because he didn't receive the "lost network authority" message yet.</p><p>We created this diagram to exemplify the problem:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/network-authority-problem-87e59351e261f860e32abf36e8150ffb.jpg" width="851" height="681"></p><p>As you could notice, there is a "gap" and a "overlap" when switching network authority if we have discrepancies between players ping, causing several weird behaviors on physics objects.</p><p>Considering this and after much study, we improved our Network Authority system to make it more robust, this new way aims to fill up the gaps and ignore overlaps:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/network-authority-solution-de8bc19f65f84cf7fafa9f2a6fe086b8.jpg" width="850" height="681"></p><p>While still in a "beta" version, with this new system we intend to improve all the "warnings" and flickering problems that were occurring since then, all feedback is appreciated!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="new-debug-modes">New Debug Modes<a class="hash-link" href="#new-debug-modes" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>With the addition of the new Network Authority system, we are adding a new <strong>Debug</strong> section in the Settings.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/debug-settings-885b03f9c7b3d5c87f58b1cf04773aae.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p>A cool setting is the <strong>Draw Network Debug</strong> which draws on World all network information:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/debug-visualizer-c087044d005e1ae370cc83cde211dad4.jpg" width="1916" height="1079"></p><p>You can find more information in the <a href="https://docs.nanos.world/docs/next/core-concepts/scripting/authority-concepts#debugging-network--network-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Network Authority</a> page.</p><p>Also you can fake "packet loss" which will simulate some Sync Data being discarded.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="store-api">Store API<a class="hash-link" href="#store-api" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/swagger-137c5ff2a490efb7ffa89089cedfddd4.png" width="1400" height="392"></p><p>Last month we released our <a href="https://store.nanos.world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Store</a>, a place to share and download community Assets &amp; Packages, integrated with the game.</p><p>Now we are releasing the <strong>Store API</strong>: You can download, upload and edit your resources through HTTP requests, check it the Swagger documentation at <a href="https://api.nanos.world/store/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.nanos.world/store/docs</a>.

A Preview release means most of the features are already present and almost ready for a final shipping version.</p><p>And we, as good enthusiasts, and in addition to our other blog news (<a href="https://nanos.world/blog/november-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November: Unreal Engine 5?</a>) decided to give another try on converting nanos world into Unreal Engine 5. And let's move to our impressions:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="migrating-nanos-world">Migrating nanos world<a class="hash-link" href="#migrating-nanos-world" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h3><p>This time migrating nanos world to Unreal Engine 5: Preview was more trickier, we've got even more deprecated methods and some functionalities changed and/or removed, which required more hard work converting and debugging what has changed.</p><p>We've had to update a lot more code and files than the Early Access version to be able just to launch the Project. Also Vehicles had to be disabled due the new Chaos engine, which completely changes how Vehicles need to be implemented and we didn't want to bother on converting them right now.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="graphics">Graphics<a class="hash-link" href="#graphics" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h3><p>Unreal Engine 5 introduces <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/lumen-in-ue5-let-there-be-light" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lumen</a>, a new dynamic Global Illumination method, and playing with it is very cool and impressive. Here's some screenshots taken from our Testing Map:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-graphics-01-81409553f59c529ff3a46808a41de510.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-graphics-02-a1be36a6c9eb72ab068dfca6311cc566.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-graphics-03-f6d93e48336c065b745d501fe070a724.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-graphics-08-ab9dd06f3548c19ccd38d4f94979435e.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-graphics-09-e4fa61287c021b5692a34e1ae98267d4.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-graphics-10-d5a77676b24b961c14dc264d6e0c5271.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><div class="admonition admonition-tip alert alert--success"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="12" height="16" viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>tip</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p>Next you can see how the object colors can reflect dynamically in the environment lights.</p></div></div><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-graphics-04-6bc9516fd9311d9967287055f9701304.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-graphics-05-d40073ca9dfbced6c6bf82627fc61c63.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-graphics-06-2592f22a6d54f62b925e6401c5a75e07.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-graphics-07-6898fe4b319a59a069e11eb7b999dcf6.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><div class="admonition admonition-tip alert alert--success"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="12" height="16" viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>tip</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p>Here we can see the contribution of Emissive Materials to the environment.</p></div></div><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-graphics-11-a2167789320906715988a5adebbd1b2f.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p>A cool feature is that we can enable Hardware-Accelerated for calculating Lumen (which replaces Hardware Ray Tracing), and tested with a RTX 3070 makes it even more beauty at a really low GPU cost.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="technical">Technical<a class="hash-link" href="#technical" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h3><p>In the technical aspect, the biggest changes Unreal 5 brings are:</p><ul><li><strong>Lumen</strong> (Dynamic Global Illumination)</li><li><strong>Nanite</strong> (Mesh Virtualization)</li><li><strong>Chaos</strong> (new Physics Engine)</li><li>and also not less important, the new features regarding World/Level creation (<strong>One File Per Actor</strong> and <strong>World Partition</strong>)</li></ul><p>While Lumen, Nanite and World features can be toggled on or off (we can choose to use it or not), the same truth is not valid for <strong>Chaos</strong>. Unreal is completely removing PhysX and replacing by it's new Physics Engine: <strong>Chaos</strong>. Although we are open to new things, unfortunately Chaos doesn't seem to be in a totally good state, neither at least at the same level/stability as PhysX.</p><p>We could experience several Collision glitches, such as objects flickering, wrong "collision boxes", objects flying through walls, bugs with Rope (Cable), objects sleeping randomly, bad Hit events callbacks and so on.</p><p>Most of the problems we could find an workaround (like applying force to some objects so they don't sleep, or finding a workaround on the Cables settings), but the main problem we've found using Chaos is the Hit feedback event, which are totally inconsistent, sometimes they are triggered with force 0, which annoys the hit sounds and also the nanos world Hit events from being triggered, and this can break gameplay/scripting functionalities.</p><p>Not to mention the objects flickering/disappearing/losing collisions which gives a really bad impression on the game quality.</p><p>And we didn't even started implementing the new Chaos Vehicles, can't wait what we gonna find there 😅.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="stability">Stability<a class="hash-link" href="#stability" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h3><p>Actually, this version of Unreal surprised us positively, it had less crashes than in early access, but still had some, but in this case it was when we were stressing the game really hard using several balloons, cables and props flying around. Although I was a little disappointed as most of the bugs I found in the Early Access were still prevent in this Preview and weren't yet fixed.</p><p>Also some rare bugs could be noticed, like suddenly being teleported to the 0, 0, 0 location, which we couldn't yet find the reason.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="ue5-worth-it-now">UE5 worth it now?<a class="hash-link" href="#ue5-worth-it-now" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h3><p>Summing up, we've created a list of positive and negative points according to our view regarding if we should or not migrate to Unreal 5 "right now":</p><p>Also, another point to consider: we are going to migrate to Unreal Engine 5 soon or later, the decision is "when". 😉</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="negative-points-">Negative Points 👎<a class="hash-link" href="#negative-points-" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h4><ul><li>Gameplay Bugs related to Physics, objects jumping, flickering, bad collisions happening, objects passing through floor/walls due <strong>Chaos</strong>.</li><li>Visual Artifacts, not only related to Lumen, but to the standard Rendering methods as well.</li><li>Random Unreal internal Crashes, which we cannot fix by ourselves.</li><li>More frequent Unreal updates, much probably we are going to have other Preview version, and after the UE5 release we are going to get several hotfixes, and each one will much likely require us from rebuilding all assets and publishing a new version of them, otherwise they won't work in the new versions. This means the Asset Packs won't work in newer Unreal versions.</li><li>Using Lumen has it's drawbacks, such as the performance, which can hit from 25% to 50% of the FPS (but can be toggled on/off).</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="positive-points-">Positive Points 👍<a class="hash-link" href="#positive-points-" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h4><ul><li>We are going to be the first ones to explore Unreal Engine 5 (which can be bad because some problems no one figured out yet, but personally I love exploring new features and using new tools).</li><li>nanos world will have a great self-marketing potential, and also can bring lots of new enthusiasts on UE5 to know, play and create with the game.</li><li>Lumen is fun and beautiful.</li><li>New World/Level tools which allows creating big maps and also improves a lot the co-creations pipelines using the <strong>One File Per Actor</strong> system and <strong>World Partition</strong>!</li><li>New Unreal Editor which has a fresh and pleasing look.</li><li>Lots of new tools and technology to use, including Nanite, Chaos Destruction, Animation tools (which can help us from dynamically linking your custom Animation Blueprint) and the new MetaSounds.</li><li>It's really hard to convert nanos world from scratch every update to test it's stability, I can't reuse the previous conversion because many changes are in blueprints (UI) that I can't merge and lots had changed since then. So converting once and right now we can already start digging, fixing stuff and the next unreal updates will be easier and faster to test and maintain.</li></ul><p>Unlike Early Access, this version seemed to have more positives than negatives points, and it seems like a better opportunity than before to officially migrate nanos world. Come to our <a href="https://discord.nanos.world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> to discuss this idea with us!

Personally this is something I wanted to do as soon as possible because Unreal Engine 5 features are amazing, not to mention the publicity and marketing bonuses we would get for nanos world.</p><p>In this month, we decided to give a try: we tested porting nanos world to Unreal 5, at first we had some problems because of some Unreal modules have been completely renamed or even removed. And also we got some Unreal methods deprecated by the newer version, so we needed to update them and even reimplement some small stuff.</p><p>Currently Unreal Engine 4 uses PhysX physics and in Unreal 5 all the Physics Engine have been replaced by <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/PhysicsFeatures/ChaosVSPhysxOverview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unreal's Chaos</a>, which is a new Engine replacing the NVIDIA's PhysX.</p><p>This made us need to disable Vehicles for this test, as Unreal vehicles are very dependent on the PhysX engine and I would need to reimplement them using the new Chaos API for vehicles (I believe that our Vehicles API will need to change a bit as well once we fully update it).</p><p>But after half of dozen adaptions and disabled Vehicles, the results were surprisingly good! nanos world worked on Unreal Engine 5! Personally I got very happy and proud that the biggest problems I had was updating deprecate methods and updating some Unreal modules, thanks to the architecture developed so far in nanos world!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="graphical-results">Graphical Results<a class="hash-link" href="#graphical-results" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h3><p>nanos world on Unreal Engine 5 is beautiful, joying with Lumen and Global Illumination is really fun!</p><p>There were some graphical artifacts (such as changing the time of day too fast causing a delay/ghosting effect), but I believe they will improve them for the final Unreal Engine 5 version.</p><p>Check it out some screenshots taken during the tests trying the Global Illumination and Lumen:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-outside-053681aeb9b681e37261b9f7b9b4b531.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-inside-gas-01-732adef7d75375ac86d95f4507b828fe.jpg" width="1916" height="1079"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-inside-gas-02-b68679c2e0428ea57fb6c283f798f50e.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-inside-flash-01-babc950dd37dfd1eb1c79fb29e202715.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-inside-flash-02-25a13edcbc3eaa5cdc6f16e70b8bea77.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-inside-flash-03-ca53b17e598a56ef52d64acb758ecc8a.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="stability">Stability<a class="hash-link" href="#stability" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h3><p>Unfortunately the stability was extremely bad.

But I decided that currently is not time yet. During the tests we had several crashes (random ones, related to the low-level of Unreal, mainly coming from Chaos Engine and from Water) that made us conclude that is better to wait a better stable version because it makes nanos world really unplayable. Those random crashes are extremely bad as sometimes it's hard to know if it's my or Unreal's fault.</p><p>Fortunately, with this we could prove ourselves that nanos world will, when the time comes, be compatible and updated to Unreal Engine 5!</p>]]></content>

Here's the highlights:</p><ul><li>Now Basic Structs <a href="/fr/docs/scripting-reference/utility-classes/vector">Vector</a> and <a href="/fr/docs/scripting-reference/utility-classes/rotator">Rotator</a> are automatically compressed when sending through the Network. Reducing it's size up to 90% in the best case! This was a great gain for network use.</li><li>A new setting was added <code>Profiling</code> which you can enable with <code>--profiling</code> on server and in Settings on Client. This will log all the time elapsed to run operations/scripting events and some other stuff in the Console.</li><li>Now HTTP requests (a.k.a. downloading files when joining a server) are automatically compressed, which may reduce the network usage when downloading big files!</li><li>Now Actors which are very far or not on screen will be synchronized/updated half the time to improve performance. We still want to tweak it and make it more aggressive on some cases.</li><li>The Assets Loading system have been reworked and is much faster now.</li><li>Small <a href="/fr/docs/scripting-reference/classes/prop">Props</a> (radius &lt; 200) will not collide with players or dynamic objects anymore. Also Bigger props will have CCD disabled by default (which drastically improved performance), this can be enabled in the Prop constructor.</li><li>Now VOIP uses Steam system, which provides a great compression and also custom settings through Shift+Tab menu.</li><li>Several improvements were made on our low-level Lua code to boost scripting performance.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor

debug shapes in 3D world: <a href="/fr/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client#drawdebug">Client.DrawDebug...()</a>.</li><li>Changed <a href="/fr/docs/scripting-reference/static-classes/client#sethighlight">Client.SetHighlight()</a> parameters, now it takes a Enum to define how the highlight will be.</li><li>Added new method <a

Avec la simple amélioration consistant à ajouter des animations de tir à cela, regardez comme c'est mieux :</p><video controls="" allowfullscreen="true"><source src="/videos/blog/weapons-improvements/m1911.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><video controls="" allowfullscreen="true"><source src="/videos/blog/weapons-improvements/makarov.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="nouveaux-effets-pour-les-obus-à-balles">Nouveaux effets pour les obus à balles<a class="hash-link" href="#nouveaux-effets-pour-les-obus-à-balles" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>En plus des nouvelles animations, nous avons ajouté un détail subtil : <strong>Bullet Shells Drop SFX</strong>. Et pas si simple que ça ! Le son est joué avec précision à l'endroit et au moment où les obus frappent le sol ou toute autre surface, écoutez :</p><video controls="" allowfullscreen="true"><source

améliorations en détail ! <iframe width="620" height="347" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ln4AUntcyLM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" mark="crwd-mark"></iframe></p><br><br><p>Notez que les animations et la visée des armes de nanos world sont entièrement générées de manière procédurale, ce qui signifie que lorsque vous êtes à la première personne, l'emplacement du viseur de l'arme est calculé dynamiquement pour être positionné au milieu de vos yeux, dans un véritable mode première personne.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="sons-lors-du-ramassage-dobjets">Sons lors du ramassage d'objets<a class="hash-link" href="#sons-lors-du-ramassage-dobjets" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>Un détail sonore subtil a été ajouté lorsque vous saisissez et laissez tomber une arme, et aussi maintenant l'objet est légèrement projeté vers l'avant :</p><video controls="" allowfullscreen="true"><source src="/videos/blog/weapons-improvements/picking-up.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h2 class="anchor

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>De nombreuses améliorations ont été apportées au mode de jeu Sandbox le mois dernier, voici les principales !</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="amélioration-de-lui-et-de-lux-du-menu-spawn">Amélioration de l'UI et de l'UX du menu "Spawn"<a class="hash-link" href="#amélioration-de-lui-et-de-lux-du-menu-spawn" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>Nous avons beaucoup réfléchi à la manière de rendre l'expérience du mode de jeu "bac à sable" encore meilleure. Et avec cela, nous avons apporté plusieurs améliorations, notamment l'ajout de catégories dans la barre latérale, de nouveaux onglets et même de nouvelles choses à frayer ! Sans compter que plusieurs corrections de bugs et l'ergonomie générale ont été améliorées ! Plus de bloquement du mouvement lors de l'ouverture du menu Spawn !</p><video controls="" allowfullscreen="true"><source src="/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/new-sandbox-ui.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="nouveaux-props-">Nouveaux Props 📦<a class="hash-link" href="#nouveaux-props-" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>Nous importons un gros paquet de props qui seront fournis avec le jeu de base.</p><p>Nous avons beaucoup débattu du seuil à ne pas franchir entre le fait de livrer le jeu avec plusieurs props ou de le livrer sans props et de permettre au joueur de télécharger ce qu'il veut depuis le Vault. C'est une décision difficile à prendre, mais pour l'instant nous avons décidé de livrer un pack de base avec quelques trucs sympas, notamment de nouveaux <strong>props de construction</strong>, <strong>fruits</strong>, <strong>outils</strong> et même de nouvelles <strong>armes</strong> !</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/fr/assets/images/new-props-3dfaf1a53c0f8ecd418a890fbab862ac.jpg" width="1920" height="1080"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="pnjs">PNJs🤖<a class="hash-link" href="#pnjs" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>Il est là depuis un certain temps, mais nous aimerions le mettre en évidence ! Dans le Spawn Menu, il y a maintenant un nouvel onglet qui permet de faire apparaître des PNJ.</p><p>Ces PNJ ont quelques fonctionnalités de base définies en Lua, ils marchent de façon aléatoire et s'enfuient même lorsqu'ils sont menacés !
