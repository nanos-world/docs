Decals are Materials that are projected onto meshes in your level, including Static Meshes and Skeletal Meshes. You can load any <code>.jpg</code> from disk during runtime and use it as parameter in your Decal Material!</p><p>As Decals are inherited from Actors, you can change it's location, rotation, attach it or call any method from <a href="/fr/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor">Base Actor</a> on it!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="new-class-billboard">New Class: <a href="/fr/docs/scripting-reference/classes/billboard">Billboard</a><a class="hash-link" href="#new-class-billboard" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/billboard-2f990d1836614cb4911de0037063db6a.jpg" width="650" height="175"></p><p>We've added another new class to spawning <strong>Billboards</strong>! A Billboard is a 2D Material that will be rendered always facing the camera. It's possible to use all custom methods from Paintable as well and spawning custom textures on it. You can tweak it's material properties with <a href="/fr/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/paintable">Base Paintable</a> or even use a material of your own.</p><p>As Billboards are inherited from Actors, you can change it's location, rotation, attach it or call any method from <a href="/fr/docs/scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor">Base Actor</a> on it!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="new-class-melee">New Class: <a href="/fr/docs/scripting-reference/classes/melee">Melee</a><a class="hash-link" href="#new-class-melee" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/melee-2a6d5eba17ca2d388e7feab8cca626d7.jpg" width="800" height="216"></p><p>We are getting a brand new very-requested class: <strong>Melee</strong>! The Melee is coming to replace the former <strong>Item</strong> class.</p><p><strong>Melee</strong> is a new Class (which works exactly as the old <strong>Item</strong>) but now with ability to attack with it. It is possible to add custom animations, a cooldown and tweak the damage of it. The attack physics is procedurally based on the animation, this means you can stab, slash or even smash things only by changing the animation and then the hit will be based on that!</p><p>The results are quite fun, the hit/damage also affects the environment dynamically 😊</p><video controls="" allowfullscreen="true"><source src="/videos/blog/november/melee.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="scripting-improvements">Scripting Improvements<a class="hash-link" href="#scripting-improvements" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>We've listen to your demand and we're finally bringing long-awaited new amazing scripting features!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="real-hot-reload">Real Hot Reload<a class="hash-link" href="#real-hot-reload" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h3><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/hotreload-4253a61702f6eb5248f5625c777c2633.jpg" width="612" height="176"></p><p>After several requests, we've started implementing a real Hot Reload feature!</p><p>The real <strong>Hot Reloading</strong> is an amazing feature which allows you loading new scripting code without needing to lose all the current memory state of your Packages. It works by loading the scripting files over the current running Lua VM.</p><p>Currently it works by manually triggering it in the console:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_I0IT language-bash theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_wNvx bash"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_jd64 thin-scrollbar" style="color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff"><code class="codeBlockLines_mRuA"><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">package hotreload </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(4, 81, 165)">[</span><span class="token plain">PACKAGE_NAME</span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">|</span><span class="token plain">all</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(4, 81, 165)">]</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copier le code dans le presse-papier" class="copyButton_wuS7 clean-btn">Copier</button></div></div><p>This will update the clients with the newer files version and load the <code>Index.lua</code> files from the packages. It will keep the current memory state of the packages as it is. It will also unsubscribe from all registered Events in that package.</p><p>In the future, it would be possible to add a real-time checker to automatically update the modified files after saving them.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="extending-classes">Extending Classes<a class="hash-link" href="#extending-classes" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h3><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/extending-8581420412041d85bb4dc0d7f9d771e6.jpg" width="823" height="319"></p><p>A new cool feature that is being added is Extending and Inheriting nanos world Classes. <em>This is still experimental and we want to collect your feedback and find remaining bugs.</em></p><p>It is now possible to <strong>Add new Methods</strong> to nanos world Classes, <strong>Override existing Methods</strong> and even <strong>Override <strong>index and </strong>newindex</strong>.</p><p>Adding a new method to a class is easy like this:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_I0IT language-lua theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_wNvx lua"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-lua codeBlock_jd64 thin-scrollbar" style="color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff"><code class="codeBlockLines_mRuA"><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">-- Adding a new method 'AddScore' to Player class</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">function Player:AddScore(score)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">    self:SetValue("score", self:GetValue("score", 0) + score)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">end</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">-- Using it</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">my_player:AddScore(10)</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copier le code dans le presse-papier" class="copyButton_wuS7 clean-btn">Copier</button></div></div><p>Read the full documentation <a href="/fr/docs/core-concepts/scripting/extending-classes">here</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="new-view-mode-topdown">New View Mode: TopDown<a class="hash-link" href="#new-view-mode-topdown" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>We created a new native View Mode: <strong>TopDown</strong>!</p><p>This ViewMode allows you to fully control Characters from a TopDown perspective.</p><p>With just a single line:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_I0IT language-lua theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_wNvx lua"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-lua codeBlock_jd64 thin-scrollbar" style="color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff"><code class="codeBlockLines_mRuA"><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">my_character:SetViewMode(ViewMode.TopDown)</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copier le code dans le presse-papier" class="copyButton_wuS7 clean-btn">Copier</button></div></div><p>nanos world becomes a completely different game, the mouse is now a crosshair which the Character aims to.

Personally this is something I wanted to do as soon as possible because Unreal Engine 5 features are amazing, not to mention the publicity and marketing bonuses we would get for nanos world.</p><p>In this month, we decided to give a try: we tested porting nanos world to Unreal 5, at first we had some problems because of some Unreal modules have been completely renamed or even removed. And also we got some Unreal methods deprecated by the newer version, so we needed to update them and even reimplement some small stuff.</p><p>Currently Unreal Engine 4 uses PhysX physics and in Unreal 5 all the Physics Engine have been replaced by <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/PhysicsFeatures/ChaosVSPhysxOverview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unreal's Chaos</a>, which is a new Engine replacing the NVIDIA's PhysX.</p><p>This made us need to disable Vehicles for this test, as Unreal vehicles are very dependent on the PhysX engine and I would need to reimplement them using the new Chaos API for vehicles (I believe that our Vehicles API will need to change a bit as well once we fully update it).</p><p>But after half of dozen adaptions and disabled Vehicles, the results were surprisingly good! nanos world worked on Unreal Engine 5! Personally I got very happy and proud that the biggest problems I had was updating deprecate methods and updating some Unreal modules, thanks to the architecture developed so far in nanos world!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="graphical-results">Graphical Results<a class="hash-link" href="#graphical-results" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h3><p>nanos world on Unreal Engine 5 is beautiful, joying with Lumen and Global Illumination is really fun!</p><p>There were some graphical artifacts (such as changing the time of day too fast causing a delay/ghosting effect), but I believe they will improve them for the final Unreal Engine 5 version.</p><p>Check it out some screenshots taken during the tests trying the Global Illumination and Lumen:</p><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-outside-053681aeb9b681e37261b9f7b9b4b531.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-inside-gas-01-732adef7d75375ac86d95f4507b828fe.jpg" width="1916" height="1079"></p><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-inside-gas-02-b68679c2e0428ea57fb6c283f798f50e.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-inside-flash-01-babc950dd37dfd1eb1c79fb29e202715.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-inside-flash-02-25a13edcbc3eaa5cdc6f16e70b8bea77.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/ue5-inside-flash-03-ca53b17e598a56ef52d64acb758ecc8a.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="stability">Stability<a class="hash-link" href="#stability" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h3><p>Unfortunately the stability was extremely bad. It didn't surprise me too much as Unreal Engine 5 is on Early Access, so bugs and crashes would happen. Several random crashes occurred during gameplay, I could notice mostly of them were caused by the new Chaos Engine (related to Physics).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="what-now">What now?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-now" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h3><p>I was really happy in being able to port nanos world to Unreal Engine 5, this attempt made us be sure that this would be possible. But I decided that currently is not time yet. During the tests we had several crashes (random ones, related to the low-level of Unreal, mainly coming from Chaos Engine and from Water) that made us conclude that is better to wait a better stable version because it makes nanos world really unplayable. Those random crashes are extremely bad as sometimes it's hard to know if it's my or Unreal's fault.</p><p>Fortunately, with this we could prove ourselves that nanos world will, when the time comes, be compatible and updated to Unreal Engine 5!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Our community has grown a lot and it's lovely to see how nice and friendly it is becoming 🥰!</p><p>The Playtest session in the Sunday was amazing! We were able to test the stability of the game very well. I can say that most of the crashes we had were related to external integration issues (WebUI or Unreal itself), which shows a great maturity of our Core system. I think about doing it more often, it was a lot of fun playing Halloween mode and testing the community game-modes!</p><p>From now on, all updates will start to be versioned (finally!), small updates/non break-changes will get a PATCH version and break-changing will get a MINOR version.</p><div class="admonition admonition-note alert alert--secondary"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p>The following changelog contains all features since last officially announced release 0.73.0.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>De nombreuses améliorations ont été apportées au mode de jeu Sandbox le mois dernier, voici les principales !</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="amélioration-de-lui-et-de-lux-du-menu-spawn">Amélioration de l'UI et de l'UX du menu "Spawn"<a class="hash-link" href="#amélioration-de-lui-et-de-lux-du-menu-spawn" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>Nous avons beaucoup réfléchi à la manière de rendre l'expérience du mode de jeu "bac à sable" encore meilleure. Et avec cela, nous avons apporté plusieurs améliorations, notamment l'ajout de catégories dans la barre latérale, de nouveaux onglets et même de nouvelles choses à frayer ! Sans compter que plusieurs corrections de bugs et l'ergonomie générale ont été améliorées ! Plus de bloquement du mouvement lors de l'ouverture du menu Spawn !</p><video controls="" allowfullscreen="true"><source src="/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/new-sandbox-ui.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="nouveaux-props-">Nouveaux Props 📦<a class="hash-link" href="#nouveaux-props-" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>Nous importons un gros paquet de props qui seront fournis avec le jeu de base.</p><p>Nous avons beaucoup débattu du seuil à ne pas franchir entre le fait de livrer le jeu avec plusieurs props ou de le livrer sans props et de permettre au joueur de télécharger ce qu'il veut depuis le Vault. C'est une décision difficile à prendre, mais pour l'instant nous avons décidé de livrer un pack de base avec quelques trucs sympas, notamment de nouveaux <strong>props de construction</strong>, <strong>fruits</strong>, <strong>outils</strong> et même de nouvelles <strong>armes</strong> !</p><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/new-props-3dfaf1a53c0f8ecd418a890fbab862ac.jpg" width="1920" height="1080"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="pnjs">PNJs🤖<a class="hash-link" href="#pnjs" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>Il est là depuis un certain temps, mais nous aimerions le mettre en évidence ! Dans le Spawn Menu, il y a maintenant un nouvel onglet qui permet de faire apparaître des PNJ.</p><p>Ces PNJ ont quelques fonctionnalités de base définies en Lua, ils marchent de façon aléatoire et s'enfuient même lorsqu'ils sont menacés ! C'est dingue !</p><video controls="" allowfullscreen="true"><source src="/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/npcs.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="nouvelles-armes-">Nouvelles armes 🔫<a class="hash-link" href="#nouvelles-armes-" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>Cela n'est pas strictement lié au mode de jeu Sandbox, mais en plus des nouveaux props, nous envoyons de toutes nouvelles armes configurées dans le package par défaut <code>nanos-world-weapons</code> !</p><p>Cela inclut un P90, un UMP-45, un pistolet M1911 et bien d'autres !</p><video controls="" allowfullscreen="true"><source src="/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/new-weapons.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="motif-darmes-">Motif d'armes 🎨<a class="hash-link" href="#motif-darmes-" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>En plus des catégories dans la partie gauche, nous commençons à ajouter une nouvelle section pour être notre "rubrique optionnelle", nous avons commencé par ajouter une nouvelle option dans l'onglet Armes : <strong>Patterns</strong>.</p><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/weapon-pattern-5a19157f2f381be41347f579f673e8ec.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/weapon-pattern-floor-d9836b881ae5d902f262d128e3e7a4ba.jpg" width="1222" height="618"></p><p><img src="/fr/assets/images/weapon-pattern-infernoo-0513481e4ee68c9d7225db4d43502de6.jpg" width="1919" height="1079"></p><p>Vous pouvez changer et sélectionner n'importe quel motif parmi les centaines inclus dans le jeu pour l'appliquer à votre arme (il est également synchronisé avec les autres joueurs) ! Il est très facile d'ajouter votre propre image <code>.jpg</code> comme motif dans le menu !</p><video controls="" allowfullscreen="true"><source src="/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/weapons-pattern.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="props-cassables-">Props cassables 🍉<a class="hash-link" href="#props-cassables-" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>C'est une fonctionnalité géniale sur laquelle j'ai travaillé ces dernières semaines, c'est quelque chose de 100% scripting, je ne suis pas encore sûr si cela doit devenir une chose intégrée.</p><video controls="" allowfullscreen="true"><source src="/videos/blog/sandbox-improvements/breakable-watermelon.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>Mais maintenant, dans sandbox, nous pouvons configurer les props pour qu'ils se brisent lorsqu'ils sont touchés ou qu'ils subissent des dégâts ! Il est également possible de configurer facilement les débris qui seront générés, l'aléatoire et bien plus encore, voir un exemple :</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_I0IT language-lua theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_wNvx lua"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-lua codeBlock_jd64 thin-scrollbar" style="color:#000000;background-color:#ffffff"><code class="codeBlockLines_mRuA"><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">SetBreakableProp("nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01", 700, {</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">    { mesh = "nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Half_01", rotation = Rotator() },</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">    { mesh = "nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Half_01", rotation = Rotator(180, 0, 0) },</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">    { mesh = "nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Crust_01" },</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">    { mesh = "nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Slice_01" },</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">    { mesh = "nanos-world::SM_Fruit_Watermelon_01_Slice_01" },</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#000000"><span class="token plain">})</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copier le code dans le presse-papier" class="copyButton_wuS7 clean-btn">Copier</button></div></div><p>Et voilà, chaque fois qu'une pastèque apparaîtra dans le menu d'apparition, elle sera cassable !</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="props-explosifs-">Props explosifs 💥<a class="hash-link" href="#props-explosifs-" title="Lien direct vers l'en-tête">​</a></h2><p>Dans une sous-catégorie comme les props cassables, nous pouvons avoir des props explosifs !
