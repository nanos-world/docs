## Introduction

Welcome to the nanos world **Quick Start** guide! After going through this guide, you will learn:

1. How to setup and join your **Server**
2. How to create a simple **Package** with basic scripts
3. How to **Spawn Props** and **Entities** through scripting
4. How to subscribe to **Game Events**
5. How to Possess a Character

This tutorial is for those who have never used nanos world server before and want to get started quickly!

## Step 1: Download the Server

To start, you need to download the nanos world server. There are **three** options to do so:

1. Use the executable at `nanos-world/Server/NanosWorldServer.exe` *(in the base game installation folder)*.
2. Use SteamCMD to [download nanos world‚Ñ¢ Dedicated Server](/core-concepts/server-manual/server-installation).
3. Download the **nanos world‚Ñ¢ Dedicated Server** tool from Steam Client.


## Step 2: Creating a Basic Package

After downloading the server, let's create a basic **Package**. A Package is a collection of Lua scripts that are executed on Client or Server to interact with the game.

To create a new Package, lets use the handy [CLI](/core-concepts/server-manual/command-line-interface) tool to speed up the process. Open a terminal in your server folder and run the following command:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cmd"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'cmd'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cmd">

```shell
./NanosWorldServer.exe --cli add package my-awesome-package
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">

```shell
./NanosWorldServer.sh --cli add package my-awesome-package
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This command will run the nanos world command-line interface (CLI) to interactively create your new Package. You will be prompted to provide some information about your Package, such as its name, author, version, and type.

```nanos-console title="NanosWorldServer"
INFO  Please enter the Package Title: (my-awesome-package)
my-awesome-package
INFO  Please enter the Package Author: ()
myself
INFO  Please enter the Package Type: (game-mode)
script
```

Once you finish creating your Package, you will find a new folder named `my-awesome-package/` inside the `Packages/` folder. This folder contains three other folders: `Server/`, `Client/`, and `Shared/`, and a configuration file called `Package.toml`.

Next, you need to tell the server to load your Package when it starts. To do that, open the `Config.toml` file located in the server folder and find the `packages = []` section.

Add your package name (`"my-awesome-package"`) to the list of Packages that should be loaded.


## Step 3: Adding Script functionalities

Now that you have a Package, it's time to add some script functionalities to it. Scripts are pieces of code that can be executed by the server/client to add custom game logic.

To add your first script, open the file `my-awesome-package/Server/Index.lua` in your preferred editor. This file is the entry point for server-side scripts in your Package.

:::tip

We recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) editor, as it contains a [nanos world Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Derpius.nanosworld) to help while coding!

:::

For this example, let's add some code to spawn some <Classes.Prop />s in the game world:

```lua title="Packages/my-awesome-package/Server/Index.lua" showLineNumbers
-- Print a message to the server console
Console.Log("Loading some Props =D")

-- Spawn some props in the game world
local prop_table = Prop(Vector(200, 0, 0), Rotator(0, 0, 0), "nanos-world::SM_WoodenTable")
local prop_chair = Prop(Vector(400, 200, 0), Rotator(0, 0, 0), "nanos-world::SM_WoodenChair")
local prop_tire = Prop(Vector(600, 0, 0), Rotator(0, 0, 0), "nanos-world::SM_TireLarge")
```


## Step 4: Starting the server

Now let's start the server with the package you just created! For that, simply double click the server executable or launch it from the terminal:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cmd"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'cmd'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cmd">

```shell
./NanosWorldServer.exe
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">

```shell
./NanosWorldServer.sh
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After starting it, your console will display something like this:

```nanos-console title="NanosWorldServer"
  INFO  nanos world (C) Copyright nanos. All Rights Reserved.
  INFO  Starting Server at Port: 7777. Version: 0.0.0. Map: 'default-blank-map'.
  INFO  Loading Package 'my-awesome-package'...
SCRIPT  Loading some Props =D
  INFO  Package 'my-awesome-package' loaded.
  INFO  Loading Package 'default-blank-map'...
  INFO  Package 'default-blank-map' loaded.
```

You can see it loaded your package and outputted the text "Loading some Props =D" on it.


## Step 5: Join your server

Now let's see the results in-game! Open nanos world and connect to localhost at `127.0.0.1:7777`.

After connecting, you will be a flying pawn and will be able to see the props spawned! üòÅ

## Extra Step: Spawning Characters

You may have noticed you are just a wandering soul flying around, let's give you some flesh! For that, we will need to interact with some **Game Events**.

### Spawning a Character for the Player

Let's append some code in your `Server/Index.lua`, to spawn a <Classes.Character /> when a <Classes.Player /> joins the server:

```lua title="my-awesome-package/Server/Index.lua" showLineNumbers
-- Function to spawn a Character and possess it to a Player
function SpawnCharacter(player)
    -- Spawns a Character at position X=0, Y=0, Z=0 with default constructor parameters
    local new_character = Character(Vector(0, 0, 0), Rotator(0, 0, 0), "nanos-world::SK_Male")

    -- Possess the new Character
    player:Possess(new_character)
end

-- Subscribes to an Event which is triggered when Players join the server
-- (i.e. Player entity spawns)
Player.Subscribe("Spawn", SpawnCharacter)

-- When this Package loads, we don't have any Character spawned and possessed, so
-- iterates for all already connected Players and give them a Character as well.
-- This will make sure you also get a Character when you reload the package
Package.Subscribe("Load", function()
	for k, player in pairs(Player.GetAll()) do
		SpawnCharacter(player)
	end
end)
```

To apply your changes, run the command in the server console: `package reload all`. This will live reload the Packages and apply the changes immediately to all Players connected.

Now you are possessed and can walk around and interact with the Props!


### Destroying the Character when the Player leaves the Server

Note that the <Classes.Character /> isn't destroyed automatically when the <Classes.Player /> disconnects. For that, we will need to Subscribe for when the Player leaves the server (<EventReference type="Class" class_name="Entity" event="Destroy" is_base /> event) then manually destroy the Character.

Append this code:

```lua title="my-awesome-package/Server/Index.lua" showLineNumbers
-- When Player leaves the server, destroy it's possessing Character
Player.Subscribe("Destroy", function(player)
    local character = player:GetControlledCharacter()
    if (character) then
        character:Destroy()
    end
end)
```

To apply your changes, run the command in the server console: `package reload all`.
