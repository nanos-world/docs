:::info

If the Prop was spawned by the Client. It will have all interactions disabled (e.g. it will not be able to be grabbed by Characters).

Props smaller than radius **40** units or very thin (any side smaller than **20** units) will have **CCD** (Continuous Collision Detection) enabled automatically to avoid falling through the floor or other objects. *This will slightly increase the performance cost of them!*
