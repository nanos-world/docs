All you need to know to Configure your server!


## Server Configuration File

The server Configuration file `Config.toml` is generated automatically when the server is launched for the first time. This file will always be overridden with the proper pattern after the server is loaded.

:::tip

nanos world Config files use **TOML** (Tomâ€™s Obvious, Minimal Language), please refer to [https://github.com/toml-lang/toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) for more information and syntax.

:::

```toml reference
https://github.com/nanos-world/nanos-world-server/blob/main/Config.toml
```


### Settings Detailed

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`name`** | Name of the Server |
| **`description`** | Description of the Server |
| **`max_players`** | Max amount of players allowed to join |
| **`password`** | Password to be able to connect |
| **`ip`** | Server IP. We recommend leaving it blank |
| **`port`** | Server main Port and HTTP Port (UDP/TCP) |
| **`query_port`** | Server query Port (UDP) |
| **`announce`** | Whether to announce or not in the Server List |
| **`max_tick_rate`** | Server Tick in Hz. How much the server will tick per second. We recommend leaving it 30 |
| **`log_level`** | Which Log level to output |
| **`game_mode`** | [game-mode](/docs/core-concepts/packages/packages-guide.md#game-mode) package to load -  you can only load one game-mode at once. |
| **`loading_screen`** | [loading-screen](/docs/core-concepts/packages/loading-screen.md) package to load - you can only load one loading-screen at once. |
| **`packages`** | [script](/docs/core-concepts/packages/packages-guide.md#script) packages to load |
| **`map`** | [map](/docs/core-concepts/packages/packages-guide.md#map) package to load |
| **`assets`** | Additional assets to force to load |
| **`token`** | Server Token used for authorize downloads through CLI |
| **`banned_ids`** | List of banned nanos account IDs |


## Logo Image

It is possible to have a custom image to be displayed in the server list. For that, add a file called `Server.jpg` besides the server executable with the logo you wish. The recommended size is `300x150`.

:::tip

You can pass a JPG image URL to `--logo` parameter to download and use a image from the web instead of placing it physically in the folder.

:::

:::note

Server Logo feature is only available for for Dedicated Servers.

## Map & Level

![](/img/docs/server-map.webp)

The Map (or Level) is defined in the Server's config file, this map will be loaded when the player joins the server in the client side.

To configure a map, please refer to [Packages Guide](/docs/core-concepts/packages/packages-guide.md#map) to create a Map Package pointing to the correct Asset.

nanos world counts on (for now) 4 built-in maps: `default-blank-map`, `default-empty-map`, `default-ocean-map` and `default-testing-map` which can be used in your server without needing to download any Package/Asset Pack.

### One-liner Server Configuration

With Command Line Parameters and [Command Line Interface (CLI)](/core-concepts/server-manual/command-line-interface.mdx), it is also possible to automate the full server installation, here's an example:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="windows">

Installs all needed Packages (this will install needed Assets as well), then starts the server with all configs set:

```shell
./NanosWorldServer.exe --cli install package sandbox battlefield-kill-ui ts-fireworks-tools
```
```shell
./NanosWorldServer.exe --name "nanos world Amazing Sandbox" --description "Awesome Sandbox Server" --map "nanos-world::TestingMap" --game_mode "sandbox" --packages "battlefield-kill-ui,ts-fireworks-tools" --port 7777 --query_port 7778 --max_players 32 --logo "https://i.imgur.com/vnB8CB5.jpg"
```

Or, just start the server passing with all configs set and auto downloads the packages and assets if needed:

```shell
./NanosWorldServer.exe --name "nanos world Amazing Sandbox" --description "Awesome Sandbox Server" --map "nanos-world::TestingMap" --game_mode "sandbox" --packages "battlefield-kill-ui,ts-fireworks-tools" --port 7777 --query_port 7778 --max_players 32 --auto_download 1 --logo "https://i.imgur.com/vnB8CB5.jpg"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">

Installs all needed Packages (this will install needed Assets as well), then starts the server with all configs set:

```shell
./NanosWorldServer.sh --cli install package sandbox battlefield-kill-ui ts-fireworks-tools
```
```shell
./NanosWorldServer.sh --name "nanos world Amazing Sandbox" --description "Awesome Sandbox Server" --map "nanos-world::TestingMap" --game_mode "sandbox" --packages "battlefield-kill-ui,ts-fireworks-tools" --port 7777 --query_port 7778 --max_players 32 --logo "https://i.imgur.com/vnB8CB5.jpg"
```

Or, just start the server passing with all configs set and auto downloads the packages and assets if needed:

```shell
./NanosWorldServer.sh --name "nanos world Amazing Sandbox" --description "Awesome Sandbox Server" --map "nanos-world::TestingMap" --game_mode "sandbox" --packages "battlefield-kill-ui,ts-fireworks-tools" --port 7777 --query_port 7778 --max_players 32 --auto_download 1 --logo "https://i.imgur.com/vnB8CB5.jpg"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Common Console Messages and Errors

#### `Server Tick too/extreme high! Verify the server performance! Server got stuck for Xms...`

It means the server got **stuck** for X milliseconds. The warning (_yellow_) is not something to worry about, but too many messages in _red_ could mean your server infrastructure is not that good or your scripting code is not that optimized.

Usually the server runs at 33 ticks per second (or the value configured at Config.toml), the server runs in an infinite loop in that frequency, and inside that loop all server operations are executed, such as receiving and sending network packets, triggering lua events, executing functions or callbacks, and so on.

If a single tick takes more than 33 milliseconds, this warning will appear up.

:::tip

In some shared VPS, this warning may appear up more frequently due how the VPS handles the scaling of it's machines, sometimes the provider may think your VPS is "idle" (due nanos world server using extremely low CPU) and may decrease your processing power, causing this warning show up as well.

:::


#### `Lua Stack Error: Should be X, is Y...`

This is an internal error and **should not supposed to happen**. Those are guards set around our Lua Scripting implementation to prevent bad things from happening. If this error appears it means a implementation bug happened. Please communicate immediately with the devs, and if possible how to reproduce that!


#### `...Was it supposed to happen?`

Those FATAL errors usually shouldn't happen, if you experience any, please let us know.
