All you need to know about Authority & Network Authority concepts.

import { Structs, BasicType, AuthorityType, Classes } from '@site/src/components/_nanos';

## Authority

Some Classes can only be spawned on the Server, others can only be spawned in the Client, and there are some which can be spawned in both Server or Client. The side which the Class is spawned is called **Authority**.


### Methods and Events Availability

Some methods and events in the API are only available on a specific side \(Client or Server\), others are only available in the side which spawned it Authority side\):

#### <AuthorityType.ServerOnly />**`Server Side`**

- **Methods:** can be called only in the **Server** side.
- **Events**: will be triggered only in the **Server** side.

#### <AuthorityType.ClientOnly />**`Client Side`**

- **Methods:** can be called only in the **Client** side.
- **Events**: will be triggered only in the **Client** side.

#### <AuthorityType.AuthorityOnly />**`Authority Side`**

- **Methods:** can be called only in the side which spawned this entity.
- **Events**: will be triggered only in the side which spawned this entity.

#### <AuthorityType.NetworkAuthority />**`Network Authority Side`**

- **Methods:** can be called only in the **Server** side and also in the **Client** if the Local Player is the [Network Authority](#network-authority) of this entity.
- **Events**: will be triggered only in the **Server** side and also in the **Client** if the Local Player is the [Network Authority](#network-authority) of this entity.

#### <AuthorityType.Both />**`Both Sides`**

- **Methods:** can be called in both **Server** and **Client** side.
- **Events**: will be triggered in both **Server** and **Client** side.

#### <AuthorityType.BothNetAuthorityFirst />**`Both Sides (Network. Authority First)`**

- **Methods:** *Does only apply to Events*.
- **Events**: will be triggered in both **Server** and **Client** side. But will be called in the [Network Authority](#network-authority) **Client** first (before sending to the Server). I.e. you don't need to wait for the Server to call it on all the clients, as it will be immediately called on the Client that is the Network Authority of that entity.


:::tip

All entities spawned in the **Server** will be automatically synced in the **Client**. I.e. you can access it's methods and get all data from it without needing to manually sync it.

In the same way, entities spawned in the **Client** will only exist for that Client, trying to send those entities to the server will cause errors.

## Network Authority

Another important concept in nanos world is the **Network Authority**. We have a _"distributed network authority"_ concept, which means the work of calculating physics are automatically assigned and distributed to the clients.

In general, if a <Classes.Actor /> is near an in-game Character, it's physics will be calculated by that player's computer. The Player that is responsible for calculating and sharing the results is called **Network Authority**.

The Player assigned is automatically calculated by the server and takes some things into consideration:

* The **distance** from the Character to the entity.
* If the Player is **possessing** a <Classes.Pawn />.
* If the Character is **grabbing** a <Classes.Prop />.
* If the Character is **handling** a <Classes.Pickable />.
* If the Character is **driving** a <Classes.Vehicle />.
* If the Character has just **shot** an entity (e.g. <Classes.Prop />, <Classes.Pickable />, <Classes.Vehicle />, etc).
* If the Character has just **roamed** a <Classes.Character /> with a Vehicle.

In all this cases, the Player will be automatically assigned to be the **Network Authority** of that Object. Note that this calculation is only made if the Player is possessing a Character.


### Overriding the current Network Authority

It is possible to override the current Network Authority of a specific entity by using the method <MethodReference type="Class" class_name="Actor" method="SetNetworkAuthority" is_base />.

:::tip

Under certain circumstances, actors may not be in **Distributed Network Authority** mode. This means they cannot have their current network authority changed. Example: if a player is driving a Vehicle or using a Weapon, mandatorily he is the the Vehicle and Weapons's Network Authority, and this cannot be overwritten through scripting. To validate if an Actor can have it overridden, you can use the method <MethodReference type="Class" class_name="Actor" method="IsNetworkDistributed" is_base />.

:::


You can also prevent it from being automatically distributed to other Players by calling <MethodReference type="Class" class_name="Actor" method="SetNetworkAuthorityAutoDistributed" is_base params={"false"} />.

:::caution

Always remember to restore the automatic **Network Authority Distribution** by calling <MethodReference type="Class" class_name="Actor" method="SetNetworkAuthorityAutoDistributed" is_base params={"true"} />. Otherwise that entity may behave completely weird.

### Debugging Network & Network Authority

We've added a new option in the settings to **Draw Network Debug** information in the World, you can toggle it in the settings (*Settings -> Debug -> Draw Network Debug*), it will draw squares on each entity and traces representing their networked movement.

#### Entity Square ■ Colors Meaning

The Square in the entities represent the state in the Network Authority and it's health.

|  | Color | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **<span style={{"color": "#306CCE"}}>■</span>** | **<span style={{"color": "#306CCE"}}>BLUE</span>** | You **are the current Network Authority** of that entity and the entity is sleeping. <br/>You are sharing sync data to the other players. |
| **<span style={{"color": "#30c7ce"}}>■</span>** | **<span style={{"color": "#30c7ce"}}>CYAN</span>** | You **are the current Network Authority** of that entity and the you are currently transmitting data. <br/>You are sharing sync data to the other players. |
| **<span style={{"color": "#FF00FF"}}>■</span>** | **<span style={{"color": "#FF00FF"}}>MAGENTA</span>** | You **are the Authority** of that entity. <br/>The entity was spawned on client side then you are not sending sync data. |
| **<span style={{"color": "#FFFFFF"}}>■</span>** | **WHITE** | You **are not the Network Authority** and the entity is sleeping or attached. <br/>The current Network Authority is not sending sync data because the entity is sleeping or attached. |
| **<span style={{"color": "#00A400"}}>■</span>** | **<span style={{"color": "#00A400"}}>GREEN</span>** | You **are not the Network Authority** and the entity is being synced in a **perfect** cadence (no lag - less than 2 frames - < 66ms). |
| **<span style={{"color": "#FFDA03"}}>■</span>** | **<span style={{"color": "#FFDA03"}}>YELLOW</span>** | You **are not the Network Authority** and the entity is being synced in an **good** cadence (small lag - less than 4 frames - < 132ms). |
| **<span style={{"color": "#FFA500"}}>■</span>** | **<span style={{"color": "#FFA500"}}>ORANGE</span>** | You **are not the Network Authority** and the entity is being synced in an **ok** cadence (average lag - less than 6 frames - < 198ms). |
| **<span style={{"color": "#FF0000"}}>■</span>** | **<span style={{"color": "#FF0000"}}>RED</span>** | You **are not the Network Authority** and the entity is being synced in an **bad** cadence (big lag - more than 6 frames - > 198ms, maybe even with packet loss). |
| **<span style={{"color": "#000000"}}>■</span>** | **BLACK** | You **are not the Network Authority** and the entity is skipping packets received from the network, due they are coming in wrong order (cause of bad connection - maybe even with packet loss). |


#### Entity Arrow → Traces Colors Meaning

The Arrow Traces in the entities represent the network data received from the server. If you are the network authority you won't see the arrow traces. The arrow points from where the entity is currently in your machine and where it should be accordingly to the network authority.

| Color | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **<span style={{"color": "#00A400"}}>GREEN</span>** | The entity is receiving packets in a **perfect** cadence (no more than 2 frames delay). |
| **<span style={{"color": "#FFDA03"}}>YELLOW</span>** | The entity does not receive any packet for more than 2 and less than 4 frames. |
| **<span style={{"color": "#FFA500"}}>ORANGE</span>** | The entity does not receive any packet for more than 4 and less than 6 frames. |
| **<span style={{"color": "#FF0000"}}>RED</span>** | The entity does not receive any packet for more than 6 frames. |
