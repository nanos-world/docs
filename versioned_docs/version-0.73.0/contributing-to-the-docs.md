You can access the [nanos world official docs Crowdin page](https://crowdin.com/project/nanos-world-docs) and help us fulfilling the translation for all available languages! More languages can be requested! Please let us know if you want to help with a new language!

Once accepted, your suggestion will immediately apply on the docs!
